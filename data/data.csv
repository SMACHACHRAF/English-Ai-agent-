3Preface
Activate And Perform is a textbook for the Third Year Secondary Education.
It is divided into 9 modules: one review module, six learning modules and two
consolidation modules.
In addition to these modules, the book contains a preface, a book map, lists of words
covered in each module, a grammar summary, a list of irregular verbs and a chart of phoneticsymbols.
Each module in the book is based on a different topic and consists of five common core
sections and additional material for the Arts branch.
All modules start with an “Introductory Activities” section followed by four sections
focusing respectively on LISTENING, READING, SPEAKING and WRITING. At the end ofeach module a list of the targeted lexical items is provided.
There is a balance of skills in the book. And ,although each section of each module is
devoted to one basic skill, the materials proposed integrate the four skill areas.
Besides class work, there are homework activities and mini-projects assigned throughout
the book.
We hope that this book will help students activate their background knowledge, learn more
English and improve their language skills and that the topics and tasks will prove useful.

B. Read the whole text and answer the questions
below.
I’m really overwhelmed …
Parenting is a job like no other, I realize that , but how come sometimes parents
exert much pressure on their children ? My parents have high expectations of me.Even though they say they don’t expect anything but my best, they really do.
My dad was a professional athlete and practiced all the time. I play a lot of
softball and am real serious about it, but it’s like he pushes me over the edge withweekend practices and constantly talking about technique and concentration. I amreally overwhelmed sometimes. He also wants me to be the student he never wasor something because if I get a B  on a test, he always tells me in some form oranother that I didn’t study hard enough and that a B is not satisfactory.
20
ReadingSection three
21It’s not like I’m not pushing myself hard , but sometimes I feel like if I’m ever going
to be anyone I have to perfect everything I do. I just wished he would be happy tohear that I’m getting a B, but he’s not. I need him to be.
That’s just my dad. My mom is always complaining about how unorganised and
sloppy I am. In all the worrying and rush to become perfect, I have to be clean andwell-mannered along the way. She also wants to control every aspect of my life.
Like one time for example, I was having my heart broken for some boy and I
was having a good cry with my best friend over the phone. Well, my mom justbarged in and she tried to make me tell her what was wrong. I told her I wanted tobe alone with my thoughts. She just wouldn’t leave so I finally told her about thesituation, and guess what she asked ? “ What is his name ?” She was trying to findout who he was !
She wasn’t concerned about how I was feeling. When I wouldn’t tell her, she
said she had a right as my mom to know. I still didn’t tell her, so she left my roomand was mad at me for the whole night. I just don’t understand.
I love my parents, but I think things turn out better if I keep my problems to
myself. They always blow the problem out of proportion, then try to help me solveit. My life is my life, but they want it to be theirs. I feel like a puppet sometimes.

The Christmas PresentAS YOU READ
A. Read the whole text and check your prediction.
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all .And sixty cents of it was in pennies.
Pennies which Della had saved  one at a time. Three times Della counted it. One dollarand eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. Della started crying.
Let us take a look at the home in which she lives. It is a small furnished apartment at
eight dollars a week. Everywhere there are signs of poverty.
Della finished crying, got up, and began to powder her face . She stood by the window
and looked out with little interest at a gray cat  walking along a gray fence in a graybackyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas day, and she had only $ 1.87 with which to buyJim , her husband , a present. She had been saving every penny she could for monthswith this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater thanshe expected. They always are. Only $ 1.87 to buy a present for Jim. She had spentmany happy hours planning for something nice for him, something fine and rare,something  worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.
There was a narrow mirror between the windows of the room. Suddenly Della turned
from the window and stood before the mirror. Her eyes suddenly began to shinebrilliantly, although her face turned a little pale. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and letit fall to its full length. Now, there were two possessions in which Jim and Della tookgreat pride. One was Jim’s gold watch, that had previously been his father’s and beforethat, his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s beautiful hair, which now fell about hershoulders like a beautiful cascade of water. It reached below her knees. Quickly ,now,she combed it again and arranged it properly. She hesitated for a moment and tearsappeared in her eyes.
She put on her old brown coat. She put on her old brown hat. With her eyes shining,
she flew out of the room and down the stairs to the street.
She walked some distance and finally stopped at a shop with a sign which read :
“Madame Sofronio, Hair Goods of All Kinds” . Della ran up the stairs to the second
floor where the shop was located. She was breathing heavily.“Will you buy my hair ?” asked Della.“I buy hair,” said   Madame Sofronio. Take your hat off and let me have a look at it.”Della removed her hat and let fall her beautiful hair.“Twenty dollars,” said Madame Sofronio, feeling the hair with her experienced hand.“Give it to me quickly,” said Della.Part 1 .
32The next two hours flew by quickly. She was busy looking everywhere in the stores for
Jim’s present.She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and for no one else. There wasno other like it in any of the stores and she had been everywhere. It was a platinumwatch chain, a beautiful one, worthy of the Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew thatit must be for Jim. It was like him, good taste and quality. The description applied toboth. It cost twenty-one dollars. Della hurried home with the eighty-seven cents whichremained.
When Della arrived home she was less excited, and gradually she became more
reasonable. She began to comb and arrange her hair, now cut very short, in the bestway she could. She took her curling iron and began to curl her hair carefully. Then shelooked at herself in the mirror critically. “If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself,“before he looks at me a  second time , he’ll say that I look like a child. But what couldI do with only a dollar and eighty-seven cents ?”At seven o’clock the coffee was made and the dinner almost ready.Jim was never late. Della held the chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the tablenear the door. Then she heard his step on the stairs and for a moment she turnedwhite. The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and serious.Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two, and he had all the problems of having a family.He needed a new overcoat, and he was without gloves. Jim’s eyes were fixed uponDella, and there was suddenly an expression in them that she could not read, and itfrightened her. He simply looked at her with a strange expression. Della jumped off thetable and went toward him.
“Jim, darling,” she said “ don’t look at me in that way. I had my hair cut off and I sold
it because I wanted to give you a Christmas present. My hair will grow again – youdon’t mind, do you ? I simply had to do it. My hair grows very fast. Say “MerryChristmas” to me, Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice – what abeautiful gift I bought for you.”
“You have cut off your hair,” Jim said, as though he could not possibly understand.“ I cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just as well ? I am the same
person without my hair.”Jim looked around the room curiously.
“You say that your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of foolishness.
“It is not necessary to look for it,” said Della. ”It’s sold , I tell you – sold and gone.
It’s Christmas evening, darling . So be good to me – because I sold my hair for you.”
Jim seemed suddenly to wake up. He kissed Della. Then he took a package out of
his pocket and threw it upon the table.
“Don’t make any mistake , Della,” he said, “ about me. Nothing that could ever
happen would ever make me think less of you.”Her white fingers quickly undid the package .And then a cry of joy – and next a quickfeminine change to tears and crying.Arts
Part 2 .
33For there lay the combs , the set of combs, side and back , that Della  had admired for 
such a long time in a Broadway store window . They were beautiful combs – just thecolor to go with her beautiful hair. And now they were hers , but the hair in which shewas to wear them has gone.But at last she was able to smile through her tears and say, “My hair grows so fast,Jim” and then Della jumped up like a little cat and cried, “oh , oh ! ”
Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present, the new chain for his watch. She held it out
to him anxiously in her hand.“ Isn’t it a fine one , Jim  ? I hunted  all over town to find it. You’ll have to look  at yourwatch a hundred times a day now to find out the time. Give me your watch. I want tosee how it looks on it ”.
Instead of obeying , Jim lay down on the couch and put his hands under the back of
his head and smiled…..

Depression In Elderly Is Treatable
361.Lately, Bob has noticed his 73-year-old mother is not herself. She isn’t sleeping
through the night, and is often irritable during the day. She doesn’t want to play herweekly bridge game. In fact, she hardly seems interested in any of her usual routine.Her temper is short. Small annoyances set her off.
2.When asked, she assures Bob she’s fine-just a little down these days. Bob wonders
if this is just normal for a senior citizen. It is not normal, according to researchsupported by National Institute of Mental Health. Bob’s mom is showing signs ofdepression, a common illness among older adults.
3.Depression is not a normal part of aging, say experts. “ Typically, when an older
person no longer feels engaged and seems to stop enjoying life when he or she canno longer do his or her regular routine , that’s when the problem has moved beyondnormal toward a diagnosis of clinical depression and it is time to seek medical help.”
4.Warning signals family and friends should look for include chronic sleep problems
and inability to rest, excessive worrying, disinterest, withdrawal from friends and/ornormal activities , and complaints of chronic aches or pains that cannot be attributedto other disorders.
5.Family members are key in getting elders into treatment because, too often, elders
don’t recognize depression in themselves. Between 20 and 25 percent of older
people in hospitals have depression, and one in three senior citizens living in nursinghomes may be suffering from the illness. This information tells us we need to look in the medical settings where the elderly are.It’s important for family and care givers to be particularly vigilant in recognizing thesigns, and seeking the early intervention that can prevent full-blown depression.Especially susceptible to clinical depression are older adults who are recentlybereaved.
6.The steps to handling depression and to remember, for both seniors and their
beloved ones :•Recognize that depression is not a normal part of aging and take symptoms seriously.•Seek information from individuals and organizations experienced in helping olderadults.•Mobilize social support from relatives and friends.•Most importantly, get treated properly.
Long-term treatment might be necessary to prevent relapse or recurrence.
Getting treated is only the first step. Staying well is the challenge.

BEFORE YOU READ
A.Try to recall a time when you sacrificed something (money , time , a desire , a dream …)
for the good of others.
Tell your classmates about it .
B.  Look at the picture. Read the sentence in bold letters , the first lines and the last 
sentence and guess why Toni looks like a little girl although she’s 18 and what made of
Kirsty a self-sacrificer.
Read the whole text and check your guesses.
50My sister looks like a little girl ………..  but she’s 18.
They should be partying and swapping clothes, but a
tragic illness means one loving sister spends her timecaring for the other …
Toni Johnson is lucky to have a sister like Kirsty,
because there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for Toni.–In fact, the bond between them is strong, she’s sacrificeda large part of her life for her .
Toni turned 18 in October. It should have marked a
milestone in her life, a time for trips into town withfriends and gossiping about boyfriends.Instead, she needs 24-hour care, and is looked afterequally by Kirsty and their mum, Helen.
Although she may be a young adult, Toni looks far, far
younger. She suffers from a rare genetic conditioncalled Dyggve-Melchior-clausen syndrome, a form ofdwarfism , which means she weighs just 31/2 st *and isonly 3 ft* tall. An added complication is that she wasborn with water on the brain. As a result, she has suchsevere learning disabilities that she has the mental ageof a baby.
Toni’s just reached puberty, but can’t walk, talk or feed herself, and is still in nappies.
Although Toni’s body will age , developmentally she’ll always be a child.Water on the brain can be a complication of the condition.The condition is rare. There are only three sufferers in the UK and 10 worldwide.
“ The fact that she’d never grow up properly , get married or have children felt like a
ton of bricks falling on my head ”, says Helen.

ReadingSection three
51“ I often forget Toni is my sister ”, admits 22-year-old Kirsty , who gave up the chance
to study nursing at college to care for her , and has done so since she was five.“ She’s like my daughter. I love her so much and know her so well , it’s hard to let otherpeople look after her .”
Although Kirsty’s worked in the past, she’s given up everything to care for Toni. In the
afternoons she feeds her, then changes her nappy and bathes her before putting herto bed.Kirsty and Helen take turns at weekends.
“ I’ve been helping with Toni since she was born and I adore her” , says Kirsty. “ Since
she turned 18  I’ve started taking her to the pub once in a while . My friends are reallygood with her but are busy with their own lives, so I catch up with them for a night outwhen it’s Mum’s turn to look after Toni.
“ I do sometimes wonder what it would be like if she were like me and we could go out
clubbing together. But we have a totally different relationship. We have a lot of funtogether .She’s always laughing and saying “ hiya ” in her cute voice , which never fails to wineveryone over. We let her stay up late on Saturdays and we have a takeaway or goto  the cinema. ”
And for her 18th birthday , the Johnstons arranged a surprise party – complete with
disco and a Tom Jones impersonator – and all her friends and family came.She loves music , so Aaron, her stepbrother, comes round and plays his guitar for her.
Kirsty says she’s prepared to dedicate the rest of her life to Toni. “ I’d like a family of
my own one day , but not yet. I’m too young and I’ve got my hands full with Toni ”, shesays.“ I know her better than anyone else does. Even when I’m not with her, I think abouther all the time. Sometimes I can’t get to sleep for worrying about her.I know if there comes a point when mum can’t look after her any more, I will take overcompletely and we’ll live together. I just can’t imagine us ever being apart. ”

Helen keller : ………………………
(1)“ I feel that in this child I have seen more of the Divine than has been manifest
in anyone  I ever met before ” – Alexander Graham Bell . “ My children understand
her …  But The children of the future will understand her even better , for they will beliberated and will know how the spirit can prevail over the senses ” – Maria
Montessori .
“ She is fellow to Caesar , Alexander , Napoleon, Homer , Shakespeare and the rest
of the immortals. She will be as famous a thousand years from now as she is today ”– Mark Twain .
(2) At 19 months , Helen Keller permanently lost her sight and hearing when struck
by a mysterious illness. She became wild, unreachable. Alexander G. Bellrecommended The Perkins Institution in Boston, which had developed a method thathad succeeded with deaf-blind Laura Bridgman. A recent Perkins graduate, AnneSullivan, 20, accepted the challenge. At the Keller home, the strong-willed  Sullivanwon the child’s affection and obedience , constantly striving to teach her the manualalphabet. Within a month she succeeded – at the dramatic moment when Helen , atthe water pump, felt the water on one hand , the letters W-A-T-E-R  on the other.“ I left the well house eager to learn ,” Helen later wrote. “ As we returned to the houseevery object which I touched seemed to quiver with life .”Section two
Arts
(3)Once the door was opened , Helen could not learn enough. She learned to write,
and Helen and Teacher ( Miss Sullivan ) went joyously from subject to subject. WithTeacher, Helen studied at Cambridge School for Young Ladies and Radcliffe College.With the aid of Miss Sullivan and Harvard instructor John Macy, Helen wrote herautobiography The Story of My Life .  The book was a startling revelation of the rich life
Helen had achieved in spite of the blunted senses ; it was widely publicized andfavourably reviewed – “ unique in the world of literature .”
(4)After graduation, Helen and Teacher settled in Wrentham, Massachusetts, Anne
Sullivan married John Macy, with the understanding Helen was her permanent charge.Anne and John Macy helped Helen with her next book, The World I Live In .  Again,
a success.
(5)Helen actively supported the cause of the blind and women’s suffrage ;
she became  a socialist , writing tracts on social justice ; with Teacher she made lecturetours across the country. In 1913 John Macy separated from Anne ; the next year PollyThomson  joined Helen and Teacher as secretary and housekeeper.
(6)Helen’s world continued to expand. She participated in peace rallies; she lectured,
appeared in vaudeville , made a movie. She travelled extensively raising funds for theAmerican Foundation for the Blind ; she lobbied in Washington.After Anne Sullivan died ( 1936 ) , Polly Thomson became Helen’s interpreter andcompanion. They visited military hospitals during World War II and made a world tourfor the cause of the blind.
(7)Now a world figure, Helen Keller was the subject of another movie, The Unconquered , 
and a play , The Miracle Worker – attempts to document a life that testified to the
unfathomable reaches of the human spirit.

The Local United Way office realized that it had never received a donation from
the town’s richest farmer. A local volunteer calls to solicit his donation,
saying “ Our research shows that even though your annual income is over a million
dollars , you do not give one penny to charity ! Wouldn’t you give back to yourcommunity through The United Way ?”
The farmer thinks for a moment and says : “ First, did your research show that my
mother is dying after a long , painful illness and has huge medical bills far beyond herability to pay ?”
Embarrassed, the United Way representative mumbles, “Uh, no.”“Secondly, that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a
wheelchair and is unable to support his wife and six children ?”
The stricken United Way rep begins to stammer an apology but is cut off.“Thirdly, that my sister’s husband died in a dreadful traffic accident”,the farmer’s
voice rising in indignation, “leaving her penniless with a mortgage and three children?”
The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, says simply,“ I had no idea.”The farmer then says “ …and if I don’t give any money to THEM, why should I give
any to you ?”

ReadingSection three
881.Last summer , my husband and I rented a cottage for two
weeks. Previously , we had always spent our summer holidayscamping, either in England or abroad.  As some of our friends hadrented the same cottage the year before, we knew that the placewould be clean and comfortable, and also near the beach. Theday before we left home the long-range weather forecastsounded good, which made us feel even more certain of apleasant holiday. However, our high hopes were soon dashed.
2.Our problems started as soon as   we arrived, which was just
after midnight. When we unlocked the door to the cottage, wefound water everywhere; and we soon discovered  that the lightsweren’t working; therefore we spent the first night in the car.Fortunately, we managed to find an electrician and a plumberearly the next day, and by midday all our problems were over, orrather, they seemed to be over. True, the things in the house werenow in working order, but these turned  out to be the least of ourproblems; much more important was what we came to call our‘invasions’ .
3.First, there were the flies, which stayed with us for the whole
fortnight. Then there were the ants, with their annoying habits ofgetting into everything including the fridge. These, like the flies,kept us constant company. Apart from these permanentinvasions, there were also shortlived ones. One night, the housewas invaded (if that’s the right word) by a mouse, but not for long.A bat was another unwelcome visitor; and  last but by no meansleast- we had a brief visit from a snake. That was our cottage
holiday. In all our experience as campers, we have never had anytrouble with insects or animals, except once with some cows, andnow we are wondering why we ever chose any other kind ofholiday. Next year we’ll go back to camping !

The King of Flamenco
Part pop star, part serious artist, Joaquin Cortes is the reigning king of flamenco- the
foot-stamping Gypsy dance. He talked with Newsweek’s John Parry in Madrid.
– Why has your type of flamenco gained such wide international acceptance ?
–  I think because it is a blend of styles and has a more universal message. I am aGypsy, and I mix my cultural roots with classical ballet and contemporary dance.–  You were one of the first dancers to perform flamenco in front of largeaudiences. How did that come about ?– My intention and my message was that I don’t want dance to be, as it always hasbeen, reserved for the elite. I believe that everyone has a right to see dance and itshould have a popular appeal.– Why did you choose Japan for your latest tour ?– I was very excited to go back to Japan, a country I’ve visited several times before. TheJapanese people connect with flamenco, because it has something in common withtheir Kabuki theatre culture. – Are you concerned that flamenco might be corrupted through its adaptation byforeign cultures ?Flamenco is enjoying a golden age. What people want to do is experiment, and mergeit with other styles. I don’t believe that anyone will destroy flamenco by doing so.– You’ve said you want to retire from dancing at 33 and switch careers. Whatcomes next ?– The future is uncertain, but I’m open to other roles: choreographer, dance director, thecinema.– How would you like to be remembered ?– As a battler who has contributed a lot to the world of dance and culture and has beenable to broadcast a new message.

How to plan a cheap affordable vacation
Whether you have just a little money to spend on vacation, or you have been
saving all year long and have amassed a nice amount to spend on nothing butdays in the sun, your vacation can be a wonderful time to get away from the dailygrind of work and routine.
The least expensive vacation trip could be a one-tank trip to a town or rural
area in your state. You could check with your local auto club for the location ofscenic parks, historical sites, and places of interest that you might want to see.You could plan to spend at least one night at a nearby bed and breakfast, forexample, if you choose to vacation in a rural area, so you could have more timeto soak up the fresh air and the quietness of the area. If camping is your thing,every state has numerous campgrounds where you can go on and unwind andcommune with nature. On the other hand, you might want to travel to another cityand have a more exciting vacation. You could visit opera houses, amusementparks, museums, theatres, ski resorts, theme parks; concerts, and more.
Besides the auto club, the internet is an amazing wealth of information for
people who are planning their vacation. If, for example, you hear of a place thatyou think you would like to visit, you can usually find the address, directions onhow to get there from your home, how many miles it is to go there, and otherpertinent information you would need to know about the place simply by gettingon line right from your home.
If you want to travel to your destination by plane, there are also helpful Internet
sites where you can shop for the best airfares and make all of the necessary travelarrangements. Travelling by plane is only one option, of course, as you can alsotravel by train or bus too. You can also search for places to stay, such as hotels,villas, time shares, travel lodges, chalets, resorts and privately-owned vacationhomes anywhere in the world. The lists are practically endless! You could evenconsider staying at the homes of friends or relatives in order to save even moremoney.
96READINGArts
Section one
Now that you have some ideas, you will need to decide on how much you can
afford and what locations you would like to travel to. To decide what you can afford,you will have to divide up the money you have available for your vacation. Dividethe amount up by categories of travel expenses, accommodation expenses, mealexpenses and entertainment and activity expenses. Don’t worry about setting asidemoney for emergency expenses, such as car repairs, if you have a credit card tofall back on. How much you will spend on each category is up to you as there is noset formula.
Remember that your vacation doesn’t have to be expensive to be a special time
away from the daily routine of things. With some checking around to obtain thenecessary information, and a little planning, you can afford a trip away from homeanytime!

Read the texts and do the activities below.Arts
Text 1
Not Totally Entertained
1. Waking up with fingers that look like plump sausages isn’t my idea of a fun time.
It seems that most restaurants’ idea of good food is a little bit of basic ingredients anda whole lot of salt. May be their aim is to make you thirsty ; but sometimes the drynessin my mouth and the balloon effect on my body when I eat out only make me want tocook my own meals on the barbecue.
2. Not only does dining out these days seem to be saltier, but it’s also getting more
and more expensive as restaurants blame rising food prices and are passing risingcommodity costs through to the prices on their menus. The restaurant business is verymuch a here-today,gone-tomorrow existence... It’s so hard to find a good restaurant
that stays consistent over time.
Cooking out, eating in.
Perplexed by what to make for dinner ? Stores like Dream Dinners help busy people 
prepare meals ready to heat at home.
1. Americans may be losing touch with the art of cooking, but not the desire for the
comfort of homemade food. “I think every woman and every cook faces the “what doI make for dinner? dilemma . And I think these Dream Dinners are certainly filling thatneed,” says Carole Counihan, a food anthropologist at Millersville University inPennsylvania. “You don’t have to shop, you don’t have to plan, but you get, in a sense,to take credit for the cooking” 
2. The company is called Dream Dinners and, like more than a hundred similar
outfits across the country, it functions as a sort of communal kitchen where moms anddads whip up a few weeks’ worth of freezer-ready meals in just two hours. It’s homecooking –without the home.
3. Started in 2002 by two women in a Seattle suburb, Dream Dinners was the first
company to specialize in ‘meal assembly’. It works like this : Customers use a websiteto select a time and date along with the meals they’d  like to prepare –herb-crustedflank steak, perhaps, or chicken mirabella. When they arrive at the session,ingredients have been carefully doled out into stainless steel containers.
4. The process unfolds like a TV cooking show. “it’s cooking with everything laid
out for you”. The would-be chefs simply mix and season, prepping meats and fish andpizza for the oven. The prepared-but uncooked- meals are then bundled into freezerbags and aluminum containers. Cooking instructions are affixed and the meals aretaken  home in a cooler, where each customer will stockpile a dozen ready-to-cookmeals.Text 2

2. Read text 1 and answer the following question :
The writer decided to cook his own meal for some reasons. What are they ?

3. Explain the following sentence using your own words :
“ The restaurant business is very much  a here- today, gone-tomorrow existence ”.
4.Is the writer in text 1 exaggerating or describing objectively what happens in some 
restaurants nowadays ?Find examples in the text to justify your answer.
Read text 2 and
1. Say whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answers.
– Americans don’t like home-made food (     )  – Dream Dinners help both men and women (      )
2. Tick the correct alternative
a) bundled (§4) means
-mixed-paid-quickly put together
b)  a cooler(§ 3) is
-a very short time-a device for keeping things cool-a plastic bag  
c)  With Dream Dinners, the customers
-cook the meals at home and eat them out-prepare the meals out and eat them at home-cook the meals out and eat them out
d) The “would-be chefs” are :
-the people who work with Dream Dinners-the people who sell the ingredients-the customersArts
102Arts
3. How does Dream Dinners work ? Read the text again and reorder the following 
sentences to answer the question. The first one has been done for you.
- you go to Dream Dinners. (     )
- you mix and season the ingredients. (     )- you follow the cooking instructions to prepare your meal at home. (     )- you take the uncooked ready- to cook meals. (     )- you use a website to choose a time, date and the meal(s) you like to prepare. ( 1 )          - the ingredients are prepared for you at Dream Dinners. (     )
4. Can you draw any conclusions about the eating habits of Americans ?
- What are your eating  habits ?
Exploring grammar
Focus on the following sentences
1. the prepared meals are bundled into freezer bags.
2. ingredients have been carefully doled out into stainless steel containers.
Who bundles the prepared meals  in sentence 1? ……………………….Who has doled the ingredients out in sentence 2 ? ………………………Are the people who do the actions important in these sentences ?
Complete the rule about the use of the passive :
The passive is often used to focus more on the  ……….than on the …………
who does it. It is used when the doer is not  …………….. or not known. An object in an
active sentence would be the …………… in a …………. sentence.
AFTER YOU READYou are going to do a survey about the eating habits in your class.

One day a police car pulled up to grandma’s house and grandpa got out.
The officer explained that the elderly gentleman said he was lost in the park.
“Why, Bill,” said Grandma, “ You’ve been going there for over 30 years !
How could you get lost ?” Leaning close to Grandma so that the police officer
couldn’t hear, he whispered, “Wasn’t exactly lost. I was just too tired to walk home.”

Genetics is the science that studies all aspects of inherited characteristics.
Genetic engineering is the application of the knowledge obtained from geneticinvestigations to the solution of such problems as food production, waste disposal,medicine production and diseases.Included in genetic engineering techniques are a range of procedures that alter thereproductive and hereditary processes of organisms.Depending on the problem, the procedures used may involve artificial insemination,cloning, in vitro fertilization, or the direct manipulation of the genetic material itself by therecombinant DNA technique.

The following statements are related to Genetic Engineering of animals and plants /
crops.Read and say whether the statement is for or against Genetic Engineering (GE).Tick where necessary.
A. Genetic Engineering of animals
Statements For Against
1.Transgenic animals can be created so that their organs can be
transplanted into human beings.
2.Genetic Engineering , combined with cloning , can be applied to
animals to make valuable pharmaceuticals.
3.Saving endangered species or salvaging extinct ones is merely
science fiction.
4.If you are faced with death by heart failure or the offer of an
animal heart transplant, which would you choose ?
5.Many scientists report emotional difficulties with what they have
to do to animals.
6.New breeds of farm animals can be made more quickly by GE
with precisely determined characteristics like lean meat (containinglittle or no fat) or fast growth.
7.We could recreate extinct species by cloning the DNA and
inserting in suitable host cells, thus  maintaining global biodiversity.
8.Cloned animals have chromosomes which show structural
modifications equivalent to adult animals. Thus , they are old beforetheir time. “ Dolly” the sheep was “ mutton dressed as lamb”.
9.There is a big risk when transplanting animal organs into human
beings that animal diseases and dormant viruses in animalgenomes could be transferred to the human population.
10.Dolly the sheep was cloned to produce a sheep whose milk had
more proteins that are believed to help treat diseases  such asemphysema , hemophilia and cystic fibrosis.

cause brain cancer were dismissedyesterday by scientists after thebiggest ever study into their safety.
They ruled out concerns that
holding a handset near the headcould trigger a rare type of tumour.The scientists studied 10 years ofmobile phone use by 4,000 peoplein five European countries includingBritain. But experts warned therewere other health concerns and itcould take up to 30 years to provethe technology does not pose long-term threat.
Thousands of lives could be savedby a hi-tech camera developed inBritain which can instantly detectthe deadliest  form of  skin cancer .Malignant melanoma is the mostrapidly- increasing cancer in theUK, affecting 5000 a year and killing1500. If caught early, however , itcan normally be cured.The camera has been developedover 12 years by the clinicaltechnology firm Astron Clinica withAddenbrooke’s and BirminghamUniversity. Thomas Carter of Astronsaid it could save hospitals hugesums by catching the diseasesearly.Doctors say results are verypromising.
A ten-year  research project todevelop a genetically- modified peahas been abandoned after it wasfound to trigger allergic reactionswhen fed to mice. The mice’s lungtissue became inflamed, creatingmucus and affecting their breathing.The reaction was not lifethreatening, according to theresearchers. The gene added to thepea was taken from a strain
of
beans considered safe for humanconsumption, so the allergicreaction in the mice was surprising.Critics claim the development is aserious blow to supporters ofgenetic modification as it shows thetechnology can have unexpectedand harmful results.

While preliminary testsindicated the 12-year-old  was notinfected with the deadly H5N1strain, experts still suspect the viruskilled her. The boy caught thedisease after playing with thedecapitated head of an infectedchicken. The World HealthOrganisation believes the Turkishvictims caught the disease fromcontact with infected poultry,in most cases children playing withbirds or helping families kill them forfood. 
PRICKING the skin for blood-sugar testing is a painful nuisance fordiabetics. American scientist Jack Aronwitz claims to have found theanswer in a patch which draws blood sugar through the pores anddetects sugar levels below the skin surface, which can then be measuredby a small meter from colour changes in the patch. The patch has givengood results in U.S. trials. It should be available here next  year .The number of people withinternet access leapt from 7.1million to 18.6 million from 1998to1999.

Read the story and do the activities below.
True love
Part 1 .
My name is Joe.That is what my colleague, Milton Davidson, calls me. He is a
programmer and I am a computer. I am part of the Multivac-complex and amconnected with other parts all over the world. I know everything. Almost everything.
I am Milton’s private computer. I am his Joe. He understands more about computers
than anyone in the world, and I am his experimental model. He has made me speakbetter than any other computer can.
“ It is just a matter of matching sounds to symbols, Joe,” he told me. “I know the
symbols in yours, and I can match them to words, one-to-one”. So I talk. I don’t thinkI talk as well as I think, but Milton says I talk very well. Milton has never married,though he is nearly 40 years old. He has never found the right woman, he told me.""One day"", he said, "" I'll find her yet, Joe. I’m going to find the best. I’m going to havetrue love and you’re going to help me. I’m tired of improving you in order to solve theproblems of the world. Solve my problem. Find me true love.”
I said, ""What is true love?""
“Never mind. That is abstract. Just find me the ideal girl. You are connected to the
Multivac-complex so you can reach the data banks of every human being in the world.We’ll eliminate them all by groups and classes until we’re left with only one person.The perfect person. She’ll be for me.”
138Arts
I said, “ I am ready.”
He said, “Eliminate all men first.”It was easy. I could reach out to make contact with the accumulated data on every
human being in the world. At his words, I withdrew from 3,784,982,874 men. I keptcontact with 3,786,112,090 women.
He gave me exact measurements; he eliminated women with living children; he
eliminated women with various genetic characteristics. “ I am not sure about eyecolor,” he said. “ Let that go for a while. But no red hair. I don’t like red hair.”
Part 2 .
After two weeks, we were down to 235 women. They all spoke English very well.
Milton said he didn’t want a language problem. Even computer-translation would getin the way at intimate moments. 
“ I can’t interview 235 women,” It would take too much time, and people would
discover what I am doing.”
“ It would make trouble,” I said. Milton had arranged me to do things I wasn’t
designated to do. No one knew about that.
“ It’s none of their business,” he said, and the skin on his face grew red.      Eight were good matches and Milton said, “ Good, you have their banks. Study
requirements and needs in the job market and arrange to have them assigned here.One at a time, of course. 
That is one of the things I am not designated to do. Shifting people from job to job
for personal reasons is called manipulation. I wasn’t supposed to do it for anyone buthim, though.
The first girl arrived a week later. Milton’s face turned red when he saw her. He
spoke as though it were hard to do so. They were together a great deal and he paidno attention to me. One day he said, “ Let me take you
to dinner.”
The next day he said to me, “ It was no good, somehow. She is a beautiful woman,
but I did not feel any touch of true love. Try the next one”.
It was the same with all eight. He said, “ I can’t understand it, Joe.” You and I have
picked out the eight women who, in all the world, look the best to me.They are ideal.Why don’t they please me?”
I said, “ Do you please them?”“ That’s it, Joe. I must be their true love, too, but how do I do it?”He seemed to be
thinking all that day.
The next morning he came to me and said, “ I’m going to leave it to you, Joe. All up
to you. You have my data bank, and I am going to tell you everything about myself.Youfill in my data bank in every possible detail but keep all additions to yourself. Then youwill match it to the 235 women. No, 227. Leave out the eight you’ve seen. Fill up theirdata banks and compare them with mine. Find corrolations.” 
139Part 3 .
For weeks, Milton talked to me. He told me of his parents and his siblings. He told me
of his childhood and his schooling and his adolescence. He told me of the youngwomen he had admired from a distance.   He said, “ you see, Joe, as you get moreand more of me in you, I adjust you to match me better and better. You get to thinkmore like me, so you understand me better. If you understand me well enough, thenany woman, whose data bank is something you understand as well, would be my truelove.” He kept talking to me and I came to understand him better and better.
I could make longer sentences and my expressions grew more complicated. My
speech began to sound a good deal like his in vocabulary, word order and style.
I said to him one time, “You see, Milton, it isn’t a matter of fitting a girl to a physical
ideal only. You need a girl who is a personal, emotional,  temperamental fit to you. Ifthat happens, looks are secondary. If we can’t find the fit in these 227, we’ll lookelsewhere. We will find someone who won’t care how you look either, or how anyonewould look, if only there is the personality fit. What are looks?”
“ Absolutely,” he said. “ I would have known this if I had more to do with women in
my life. Of course, thinking about it makes it all plain now.”
We always agreed; we thought so like each other. 
“ We shouldn’t have any trouble, now, Milton, if you’ll let me ask you questions. I can
see where, in your data bank, there are blank spots and unevenesses.”
What followed, Milton said, was the equivalent of a careful psychoanalysis. Of
course, I was learning from the psychiatric examinations of the 227 women-on all ofwhich I was keeping close tabs.
Part 4 .
Milton seemed quite happy. He said, “ Talking to you, Joe, is almost like talking to
another self. Our personalities have come to match perfectly”.
“ So will the personality of the woman we choose.”
For I had found her and she was one of the 227 after all. Her name was Charity Jones
and she was an Evaluator at the Library of History in Wichita, Kansas. Her extendeddata bank fit ours
perfectly. All the other women had fallen into discard in one respect
or another as the data bank grew fuller, but with Charity there was increasing andastonishing resonance.
I din’t have to describe her to Milton. Milton had coordinated my symbols so closely
with his own I could tell the resonance directly. It fit me.
Next it was a matter of adjusting the work sheets and job requirements in such a way
as to get Charity assigned to us. It must be done very delicately, so no one would knowthat anything illegal had taken place.
Of course, Milton himself knew, since it was he who had arranged it, and that had to
be taken care of too. When they came to arrest him on grounds of malfeasance inoffice, it was fortunately, for something that had taken place 10 years ago. He had toldme about it, of course, so it was easy to arrange-and he won’t talk about me for thatwould make his offence much worse.Arts

I think genetic engineering should be very controlled. To begin with, life on our planet

been / will) be able to control the changes they are unleashing. Lastly, we should
consider (how / why / when) some governments could use genetics. They (might /
must / need to) try to create ""the perfect baby"" or design a ""master-race"". This is a
nightmare scenario, of course, but it could happen.
In the wrong (heads /hands /eyes) , genetic engineering can be used as a way of
playing with nature. Nobody knows what the effects will be if we allow this to go (in / by
/ on) without strict controls. I think all of us should stop and think (before / while / after)
we allow scientists to develop these techniques any further-our survival could dependon it !Activity 3

C. People who work in offices are referred to as “ white-collar workers ”.
Guess what we call people who do manual work,like mechanics,carpenters,dustmen …
D. A good title to the text could be:
- The best way to fool a wife.- The stupid wife of Alfred Bloggs.- The double life of Alfred Bloggs.
E. If you were in Alf’s position, would you sacrifice a good pay for the benefit of 
becoming a white-collar worker ? Why ?  Why not ?( 1 ) These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than clerks
who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as “ whitecollar workers” for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher payfor the privilege of becoming white collar workers. This can give rise to curioussituations, as it did in the  case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for theEllesmere corporation.
( 2 )When he got married, Alfred was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about
his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation . Every morning, he lefthome dressed in a fine black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the nexteight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower andchanged back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kepthis secret. Alf’s wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she neverwill, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office as a juniorclerk. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in
status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day andothers will call him “Mr Bloggs ”, not “Alf”.

pupils into polite, well-ordered students. “Disciplining an unruly child in front of thewhole class was the worst thing a teacher can do”, the researchers said. “if you wantto motivate any group of people you don’t do it by telling them off, you do it byaccentuating the positives”.
2. Nick Seaton of the Campaign for Real Education said: “This
is a ridiculous idea. To
heap unearned praise is sending out completely the wrong message. Youngsters needclear guidance on what is right and what is wrong.”
3. Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers’ union said: “ Teachers know that
praise can be used to help motivate pupils. But it is far too simplistic to say this is allyou have to do. There are some pupils whose behaviour remains disruptive no matterhow much praise is used.”
4. Dr Swinson said: “ Teachers were good at praising children for good work but rarely
praised youngsters for good behaviour. However, they spent a large proportion of theirtime telling pupils off for poor behaviour.”
5. The psychologists devised a training programme called Four Essential Steps to
Managing Behaviour. As part of the programme, teachers were asked always to maketheir instructions to the class extremely clear and to look for the behaviour they wantedrather than the behaviour they did not want. The training, which only lasted betweentwo and three hours, showed an important shift in the way teachers spoke to pupils.The most critical finding was that the average percentage of pupils who were doingwhat the teacher wanted them to do under the new system increased to 94 per cent.Dr Swinson said:  “It is clear that many teachers, prior to receiving the training wereunaware of the skills needed to deal with unruly classes and over-relied on tellingpupils off, which had very little effect on the pupils’ behaviour. The more praise therewas the fewer kids there were mucking around.”

5-Many countries will have no drinking water.

7-Wars will start between countries fighting over water.
AS YOU READ A . Read the text and find out which of the above predictions it deals with.
193Global warming is human made
1.Findings from a new study released last week prove that global warming is
caused by human activity, and not by natural environmental factors. Researchersat the Scripps Institute of Oceanography have found clear evidence of human-produced warming in the world’s oceans that is likely to impact water resources inregions around the globe. These findings remove much of the uncertaintyassociated with debates about global warming. Many world leaders have closedtheir ears to this fact so they don’t have to limit their economic activity or introduceexpensive pollution controls. This is one of the reasons America has not signed theKyoto Treaty on climate change. The US government prefers to believe globalwarming is a natural phenomenon, caused by volcanoes and solar energy.
2.Professor Tim Barnett said, “This is perhaps the most compelling evidence
yet that global warming is happening right now and it shows that we cansuccessfully simulate its past and likely future evolution.” Barnett says the resultshold implications for millions of people in the near future. In the decadesimmediately ahead, the changes will be felt in regional water supplies, includingareas impacted by accelerated glacier melting in the South American Andes and inwestern China, putting millions of people at risk without adequate summertimewater. Perhaps now more countries will sign up the Kyoto Protocol.

“Snowing, Sometimes”
I
You can’t keep it out.You could see it driftingfrom one side of the road  to the other-you could watch           the wind work it back and forth across the hard white surface.        You could see the maple, with        its ten dead leaves, winded,  wanting it. But sometimes              you couldn’t keep it out.  
II  
It was like dust, an elegance,like frost. All you had todo was stand at the windowand it passed, like the light,
over your face – softer than lightat the edges, the seams,the separations in the glass.All you had to do was stand
still in the dark and the room  seemed alive with it, crystalline,a bright breath on the air.

Read the beginning and the end of the text to find out who “ I ” , in the title, refers to. B. Read the whole text and answer the questions below. I’m really overwhelmed … Parenting is a job like no other, I realize that , but how come sometimes parents exert much pressure on their children ? My parents have high expectations of me.Even though they say they don’t expect anything but my best, they really do. My dad was a professional athlete and practiced all the time. I play a lot of softball and am real serious about it, but it’s like he pushes me over the edge withweekend practices and constantly talking about technique and concentration. I amreally overwhelmed sometimes. He also wants me to be the student he never wasor something because if I get a B on a test, he always tells me in some form oranother that I didn’t study hard enough and that a B is not satisfactory. 20 ReadingSection three 21It’s not like I’m not pushing myself hard , but sometimes I feel like if I’m ever going to be anyone I have to perfect everything I do. I just wished he would be happy tohear that I’m getting a B, but he’s not. I need him to be. That’s just my dad. My mom is always complaining about how unorganised and sloppy I am. In all the worrying and rush to become perfect, I have to be clean andwell-mannered along the way. She also wants to control every aspect of my life. Like one time for example, I was having my heart broken for some boy and I was having a good cry with my best friend over the phone. Well, my mom justbarged in and she tried to make me tell her what was wrong. I told her I wanted tobe alone with my thoughts. She just wouldn’t leave so I finally told her about thesituation, and guess what she asked ? “ What is his name ?” She was trying to findout who he was ! She wasn’t concerned about how I was feeling. When I wouldn’t tell her, she said she had a right as my mom to know. I still didn’t tell her, so she left my roomand was mad at me for the whole night. I just don’t understand. I love my parents, but I think things turn out better if I keep my problems to myself. They always blow the problem out of proportion, then try to help me solveit. My life is my life, but they want it to be theirs. I feel like a puppet sometimes. Kelly, 17 1. Who are the intended readers of this text ?

Share your prediction with your classmates’.Activity 3Arts 31Arts The Christmas PresentAS YOU READ A. Read the whole text and check your prediction. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all .And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies which Della had saved one at a time. Three times Della counted it. One dollarand eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. Della started crying. Let us take a look at the home in which she lives. It is a small furnished apartment at eight dollars a week. Everywhere there are signs of poverty. Della finished crying, got up, and began to powder her face . She stood by the window and looked out with little interest at a gray cat walking along a gray fence in a graybackyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas day, and she had only $ 1.87 with which to buyJim , her husband , a present. She had been saving every penny she could for monthswith this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater thanshe expected. They always are. Only $ 1.87 to buy a present for Jim. She had spentmany happy hours planning for something nice for him, something fine and rare,something worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim. There was a narrow mirror between the windows of the room. Suddenly Della turned from the window and stood before the mirror. Her eyes suddenly began to shinebrilliantly, although her face turned a little pale. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and letit fall to its full length. Now, there were two possessions in which Jim and Della tookgreat pride. One was Jim’s gold watch, that had previously been his father’s and beforethat, his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s beautiful hair, which now fell about hershoulders like a beautiful cascade of water. It reached below her knees. Quickly ,now,she combed it again and arranged it properly. She hesitated for a moment and tearsappeared in her eyes. She put on her old brown coat. She put on her old brown hat. With her eyes shining, she flew out of the room and down the stairs to the street. She walked some distance and finally stopped at a shop with a sign which read : “Madame Sofronio, Hair Goods of All Kinds” . Della ran up the stairs to the second floor where the shop was located. She was breathing heavily.“Will you buy my hair ?” asked Della.“I buy hair,” said Madame Sofronio. Take your hat off and let me have a look at it.”Della removed her hat and let fall her beautiful hair.“Twenty dollars,” said Madame Sofronio, feeling the hair with her experienced hand.“Give it to me quickly,” said Della.Part 1 . 32The next two hours flew by quickly. She was busy looking everywhere in the stores for Jim’s present.She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and for no one else. There wasno other like it in any of the stores and she had been everywhere. It was a platinumwatch chain, a beautiful one, worthy of the Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew thatit must be for Jim. It was like him, good taste and quality. The description applied toboth. It cost twenty-one dollars. Della hurried home with the eighty-seven cents whichremained. When Della arrived home she was less excited, and gradually she became more reasonable. She began to comb and arrange her hair, now cut very short, in the bestway she could. She took her curling iron and began to curl her hair carefully. Then shelooked at herself in the mirror critically. “If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself,“before he looks at me a second time , he’ll say that I look like a child. But what couldI do with only a dollar and eighty-seven cents ?”At seven o’clock the coffee was made and the dinner almost ready.Jim was never late. Della held the chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the tablenear the door. Then she heard his step on the stairs and for a moment she turnedwhite. The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and serious.Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two, and he had all the problems of having a family.He needed a new overcoat, and he was without gloves. Jim’s eyes were fixed uponDella, and there was suddenly an expression in them that she could not read, and itfrightened her. He simply looked at her with a strange expression. Della jumped off thetable and went toward him. “Jim, darling,” she said “ don’t look at me in that way. I had my hair cut off and I sold it because I wanted to give you a Christmas present. My hair will grow again – youdon’t mind, do you ? I simply had to do it. My hair grows very fast. Say “MerryChristmas” to me, Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice – what abeautiful gift I bought for you.” “You have cut off your hair,” Jim said, as though he could not possibly understand.“ I cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just as well ? I am the same person without my hair.”Jim looked around the room curiously. “You say that your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of foolishness. “It is not necessary to look for it,” said Della. ”It’s sold , I tell you – sold and gone. It’s Christmas evening, darling . So be good to me – because I sold my hair for you.” Jim seemed suddenly to wake up. He kissed Della. Then he took a package out of his pocket and threw it upon the table. “Don’t make any mistake , Della,” he said, “ about me. Nothing that could ever happen would ever make me think less of you.”Her white fingers quickly undid the package .And then a cry of joy – and next a quickfeminine change to tears and crying.Arts Part 2 . 33For there lay the combs , the set of combs, side and back , that Della had admired for such a long time in a Broadway store window . They were beautiful combs – just thecolor to go with her beautiful hair. And now they were hers , but the hair in which shewas to wear them has gone.But at last she was able to smile through her tears and say, “My hair grows so fast,Jim” and then Della jumped up like a little cat and cried, “oh , oh ! ” Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present, the new chain for his watch. She held it out to him anxiously in her hand.“ Isn’t it a fine one , Jim ? I hunted all over town to find it. You’ll have to look at yourwatch a hundred times a day now to find out the time. Give me your watch. I want tosee how it looks on it ”. Instead of obeying , Jim lay down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled….. O.

She isn’t sleeping through the night, and is often irritable during the day. She doesn’t want to play herweekly bridge game. In fact, she hardly seems interested in any of her usual routine.Her temper is short. Small annoyances set her off. 2.When asked, she assures Bob she’s fine-just a little down these days. Bob wonders if this is just normal for a senior citizen. It is not normal, according to researchsupported by National Institute of Mental Health. Bob’s mom is showing signs ofdepression, a common illness among older adults. 3.Depression is not a normal part of aging, say experts. “ Typically, when an older person no longer feels engaged and seems to stop enjoying life when he or she canno longer do his or her regular routine , that’s when the problem has moved beyondnormal toward a diagnosis of clinical depression and it is time to seek medical help.” 4.Warning signals family and friends should look for include chronic sleep problems and inability to rest, excessive worrying, disinterest, withdrawal from friends and/ornormal activities , and complaints of chronic aches or pains that cannot be attributedto other disorders. 5.Family members are key in getting elders into treatment because, too often, elders don’t recognize depression in themselves. Between 20 and 25 percent of older people in hospitals have depression, and one in three senior citizens living in nursinghomes may be suffering from the illness. This information tells us we need to look in the medical settings where the elderly are.It’s important for family and care givers to be particularly vigilant in recognizing thesigns, and seeking the early intervention that can prevent full-blown depression.Especially susceptible to clinical depression are older adults who are recentlybereaved. 6.The steps to handling depression and to remember, for both seniors and their beloved ones :•Recognize that depression is not a normal part of aging and take symptoms seriously.•Seek information from individuals and organizations experienced in helping olderadults.•Mobilize social support from relatives and friends.•Most importantly, get treated properly. Long-term treatment might be necessary to prevent relapse or recurrence. Getting treated is only the first step. Staying well is the challenge.

They should be partying and swapping clothes, but a tragic illness means one loving sister spends her timecaring for the other … Toni Johnson is lucky to have a sister like Kirsty, because there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for Toni.–In fact, the bond between them is strong, she’s sacrificeda large part of her life for her . Toni turned 18 in October. It should have marked a milestone in her life, a time for trips into town withfriends and gossiping about boyfriends.Instead, she needs 24-hour care, and is looked afterequally by Kirsty and their mum, Helen. Although she may be a young adult, Toni looks far, far younger. She suffers from a rare genetic conditioncalled Dyggve-Melchior-clausen syndrome, a form ofdwarfism , which means she weighs just 31/2 st *and isonly 3 ft* tall. An added complication is that she wasborn with water on the brain. As a result, she has suchsevere learning disabilities that she has the mental ageof a baby. Toni’s just reached puberty, but can’t walk, talk or feed herself, and is still in nappies. Although Toni’s body will age , developmentally she’ll always be a child.Water on the brain can be a complication of the condition.The condition is rare. There are only three sufferers in the UK and 10 worldwide. “ The fact that she’d never grow up properly , get married or have children felt like a ton of bricks falling on my head ”, says Helen. ReadingSection three 51“ I often forget Toni is my sister ”, admits 22-year-old Kirsty , who gave up the chance to study nursing at college to care for her , and has done so since she was five.“ She’s like my daughter. I love her so much and know her so well , it’s hard to let otherpeople look after her .” Although Kirsty’s worked in the past, she’s given up everything to care for Toni. In the afternoons she feeds her, then changes her nappy and bathes her before putting herto bed.Kirsty and Helen take turns at weekends. “ I’ve been helping with Toni since she was born and I adore her” , says Kirsty. “ Since she turned 18 I’ve started taking her to the pub once in a while . My friends are reallygood with her but are busy with their own lives, so I catch up with them for a night outwhen it’s Mum’s turn to look after Toni. “ I do sometimes wonder what it would be like if she were like me and we could go out clubbing together. But we have a totally different relationship. We have a lot of funtogether .She’s always laughing and saying “ hiya ” in her cute voice , which never fails to wineveryone over. We let her stay up late on Saturdays and we have a takeaway or goto the cinema. ” And for her 18th birthday , the Johnstons arranged a surprise party – complete with disco and a Tom Jones impersonator – and all her friends and family came.She loves music , so Aaron, her stepbrother, comes round and plays his guitar for her. Kirsty says she’s prepared to dedicate the rest of her life to Toni. “ I’d like a family of my own one day , but not yet. I’m too young and I’ve got my hands full with Toni ”, shesays.“ I know her better than anyone else does. Even when I’m not with her, I think abouther all the time. Sometimes I can’t get to sleep for worrying about her.I know if there comes a point when mum can’t look after her any more, I will take overcompletely and we’ll live together. I just can’t imagine us ever being apart. ” * 3 1/2 st . 2 stone = 12.7 kilograms * 3 feet = 0.9144 metres Woman AS YOU READ A. Complete the table with information from the text. B.

She will be as famous a thousand years from now as she is today ”– Mark Twain . (2) At 19 months , Helen Keller permanently lost her sight and hearing when struck by a mysterious illness. She became wild, unreachable. Alexander G. Bellrecommended The Perkins Institution in Boston, which had developed a method thathad succeeded with deaf-blind Laura Bridgman. A recent Perkins graduate, AnneSullivan, 20, accepted the challenge. At the Keller home, the strong-willed Sullivanwon the child’s affection and obedience , constantly striving to teach her the manualalphabet. Within a month she succeeded – at the dramatic moment when Helen , atthe water pump, felt the water on one hand , the letters W-A-T-E-R on the other.“ I left the well house eager to learn ,” Helen later wrote. “ As we returned to the houseevery object which I touched seemed to quiver with life .”Section two Arts (3)Once the door was opened , Helen could not learn enough.

In 1913 John Macy separated from Anne ; the next year PollyThomson joined Helen and Teacher as secretary and housekeeper. (6)Helen’s world continued to expand. She participated in peace rallies; she lectured, appeared in vaudeville , made a movie. She travelled extensively raising funds for theAmerican Foundation for the Blind ; she lobbied in Washington.After Anne Sullivan died ( 1936 ) , Polly Thomson became Helen’s interpreter andcompanion. They visited military hospitals during World War II and made a world tourfor the cause of the blind.

Previously , we had always spent our summer holidayscamping, either in England or abroad. As some of our friends hadrented the same cottage the year before, we knew that the placewould be clean and comfortable, and also near the beach. Theday before we left home the long-range weather forecastsounded good, which made us feel even more certain of apleasant holiday. However, our high hopes were soon dashed. 2.Our problems started as soon as we arrived, which was just after midnight. When we unlocked the door to the cottage, wefound water everywhere; and we soon discovered that the lightsweren’t working; therefore we spent the first night in the car.Fortunately, we managed to find an electrician and a plumberearly the next day, and by midday all our problems were over, orrather, they seemed to be over. True, the things in the house werenow in working order, but these turned out to be the least of ourproblems; much more important was what we came to call our‘invasions’ . 3.First, there were the flies, which stayed with us for the whole fortnight. Then there were the ants, with their annoying habits ofgetting into everything including the fridge. These, like the flies,kept us constant company. Apart from these permanentinvasions, there were also shortlived ones. One night, the housewas invaded (if that’s the right word) by a mouse, but not for long.A bat was another unwelcome visitor; and last but by no meansleast- we had a brief visit from a snake. That was our cottage holiday. In all our experience as campers, we have never had anytrouble with insects or animals, except once with some cows, andnow we are wondering why we ever chose any other kind ofholiday.

TheJapanese people connect with flamenco, because it has something in common withtheir Kabuki theatre culture. – Are you concerned that flamenco might be corrupted through its adaptation byforeign cultures ?Flamenco is enjoying a golden age. What people want to do is experiment, and mergeit with other styles. I don’t believe that anyone will destroy flamenco by doing so.– You’ve said you want to retire from dancing at 33 and switch careers. Whatcomes next ?– The future is uncertain, but I’m open to other roles: choreographer, dance director, thecinema.– How would you like to be remembered ?– As a battler who has contributed a lot to the world of dance and culture and has beenable to broadcast a new message. 1.

What kind of information will it probably contain ? AS YOU READ1. Read the text and check your guesses. How to plan a cheap affordable vacation Whether you have just a little money to spend on vacation, or you have been saving all year long and have amassed a nice amount to spend on nothing butdays in the sun, your vacation can be a wonderful time to get away from the dailygrind of work and routine. The least expensive vacation trip could be a one-tank trip to a town or rural area in your state. You could check with your local auto club for the location ofscenic parks, historical sites, and places of interest that you might want to see.You could plan to spend at least one night at a nearby bed and breakfast, forexample, if you choose to vacation in a rural area, so you could have more timeto soak up the fresh air and the quietness of the area. If camping is your thing,every state has numerous campgrounds where you can go on and unwind andcommune with nature. On the other hand, you might want to travel to another cityand have a more exciting vacation. You could visit opera houses, amusementparks, museums, theatres, ski resorts, theme parks; concerts, and more. Besides the auto club, the internet is an amazing wealth of information for people who are planning their vacation. If, for example, you hear of a place thatyou think you would like to visit, you can usually find the address, directions onhow to get there from your home, how many miles it is to go there, and otherpertinent information you would need to know about the place simply by gettingon line right from your home. If you want to travel to your destination by plane, there are also helpful Internet sites where you can shop for the best airfares and make all of the necessary travelarrangements. Travelling by plane is only one option, of course, as you can alsotravel by train or bus too. You can also search for places to stay, such as hotels,villas, time shares, travel lodges, chalets, resorts and privately-owned vacationhomes anywhere in the world. The lists are practically endless! You could evenconsider staying at the homes of friends or relatives in order to save even moremoney. 96READINGArts Section one Now that you have some ideas, you will need to decide on how much you can afford and what locations you would like to travel to. To decide what you can afford,you will have to divide up the money you have available for your vacation. Dividethe amount up by categories of travel expenses, accommodation expenses, mealexpenses and entertainment and activity expenses. Don’t worry about setting asidemoney for emergency expenses, such as car repairs, if you have a credit card tofall back on. How much you will spend on each category is up to you as there is noset formula. Remember that your vacation doesn’t have to be expensive to be a special time away from the daily routine of things. With some checking around to obtain thenecessary information, and a little planning, you can afford a trip away from homeanytime! 2.

Waking up with fingers that look like plump sausages isn’t my idea of a fun time. It seems that most restaurants’ idea of good food is a little bit of basic ingredients anda whole lot of salt. May be their aim is to make you thirsty ; but sometimes the drynessin my mouth and the balloon effect on my body when I eat out only make me want tocook my own meals on the barbecue. 2. Not only does dining out these days seem to be saltier, but it’s also getting more and more expensive as restaurants blame rising food prices and are passing risingcommodity costs through to the prices on their menus. The restaurant business is verymuch a here-today,gone-tomorrow existence... It’s so hard to find a good restaurant that stays consistent over time. Cooking out, eating in. Perplexed by what to make for dinner ? Stores like Dream Dinners help busy people prepare meals ready to heat at home. 1. Americans may be losing touch with the art of cooking, but not the desire for the comfort of homemade food. “I think every woman and every cook faces the “what doI make for dinner? dilemma . And I think these Dream Dinners are certainly filling thatneed,” says Carole Counihan, a food anthropologist at Millersville University inPennsylvania. “You don’t have to shop, you don’t have to plan, but you get, in a sense,to take credit for the cooking” 2. The company is called Dream Dinners and, like more than a hundred similar outfits across the country, it functions as a sort of communal kitchen where moms anddads whip up a few weeks’ worth of freezer-ready meals in just two hours. It’s homecooking –without the home. 3. Started in 2002 by two women in a Seattle suburb, Dream Dinners was the first company to specialize in ‘meal assembly’. It works like this : Customers use a websiteto select a time and date along with the meals they’d like to prepare –herb-crustedflank steak, perhaps, or chicken mirabella. When they arrive at the session,ingredients have been carefully doled out into stainless steel containers. 4. The process unfolds like a TV cooking show. “it’s cooking with everything laid out for you”. The would-be chefs simply mix and season, prepping meats and fish andpizza for the oven. The prepared-but uncooked- meals are then bundled into freezerbags and aluminum containers. Cooking instructions are affixed and the meals aretaken home in a cooler, where each customer will stockpile a dozen ready-to-cookmeals.Text 2 1011.

How does Dream Dinners work ? Read the text again and reorder the following sentences to answer the question. The first one has been done for you. - you go to Dream Dinners. ( ) - you mix and season the ingredients. ( )- you follow the cooking instructions to prepare your meal at home. ( )- you take the uncooked ready- to cook meals. ( )- you use a website to choose a time, date and the meal(s) you like to prepare. ( 1 ) - the ingredients are prepared for you at Dream Dinners. ( ) 4. Can you draw any conclusions about the eating habits of Americans ? - What are your eating habits ? Exploring grammar Focus on the following sentences 1. the prepared meals are bundled into freezer bags. 2. ingredients have been carefully doled out into stainless steel containers. Who bundles the prepared meals in sentence 1? ……………………….Who has doled the ingredients out in sentence 2 ? ………………………Are the people who do the actions important in these sentences ? Complete the rule about the use of the passive : The passive is often used to focus more on the ……….than on the ………… who does it. It is used when the doer is not …………….. or not known.

The officer explained that the elderly gentleman said he was lost in the park. “Why, Bill,” said Grandma, “ You’ve been going there for over 30 years ! How could you get lost ?” Leaning close to Grandma so that the police officer couldn’t hear, he whispered, “Wasn’t exactly lost.

A. Genetic Engineering of animals Statements For Against 1.Transgenic animals can be created so that their organs can be transplanted into human beings. 2.Genetic Engineering , combined with cloning , can be applied to animals to make valuable pharmaceuticals. 3.Saving endangered species or salvaging extinct ones is merely science fiction. 4.If you are faced with death by heart failure or the offer of an animal heart transplant, which would you choose ? 5.Many scientists report emotional difficulties with what they have to do to animals. 6.New breeds of farm animals can be made more quickly by GE with precisely determined characteristics like lean meat (containinglittle or no fat) or fast growth. 7.We could recreate extinct species by cloning the DNA and inserting in suitable host cells, thus maintaining global biodiversity. 8.Cloned animals have chromosomes which show structural modifications equivalent to adult animals. Thus , they are old beforetheir time. “ Dolly” the sheep was “ mutton dressed as lamb”. 9.There is a big risk when transplanting animal organs into human beings that animal diseases and dormant viruses in animalgenomes could be transferred to the human population. 10.Dolly the sheep was cloned to produce a sheep whose milk had more proteins that are believed to help treat diseases such asemphysema , hemophilia and cystic fibrosis. 11.There is no simple link between genes and diseases. For instance when the human retinoblastoma (eye cancer) genewas inserted into mice it produced abnormalities but there were nosymptoms of retinoblastoma. ListeningSection two 124B. Genetic Engineering of plants/crops Statements For Against 1.Genetic pollution from transgenes spreads into other organisms. It can never be reversed or cleaned up . 2.GE plants are carefully tested for environmental and ecological impact , including their effects on earthworms and beneficialinsects. 3.It reduces labour costs . 4.There are damaging irreversible effects on health caused by genetically-engineered foods . 5.GE allows the creation of plants that produce vaccines and pharmaceuticals . 6.To transfer desirable qualities from one organism to another , for example , to make a crop resistant to an herbicide or to enhancefood value . 7.The process of inserting genes can damage normal genes 8.It enhances biodiversity by allowing weeds to continue growing for longer thus providing nutrition for animals. 9.Increased use of chemicals on crops results in increased contamination of our water supply and food . 10. The loss of biodiversity in crops and the disturbance of the ecological balance . 11. We have the ability to feed the world’s population without the risks posed by GE . Section three Reading A.

Match the extracts from the articles below to the headlines and find out whether you guessed right . 1 2 3Article Headline Fears that mobile phones can cause brain cancer were dismissedyesterday by scientists after thebiggest ever study into their safety. They ruled out concerns that holding a handset near the headcould trigger a rare type of tumour.The scientists studied 10 years ofmobile phone use by 4,000 peoplein five European countries includingBritain. But experts warned therewere other health concerns and itcould take up to 30 years to provethe technology does not pose long-term threat. Thousands of lives could be savedby a hi-tech camera developed inBritain which can instantly detectthe deadliest form of skin cancer .Malignant melanoma is the mostrapidly- increasing cancer in theUK, affecting 5000 a year and killing1500. If caught early, however , itcan normally be cured.The camera has been developedover 12 years by the clinicaltechnology firm Astron Clinica withAddenbrooke’s and BirminghamUniversity. Thomas Carter of Astronsaid it could save hospitals hugesums by catching the diseasesearly.Doctors say results are verypromising. A ten-year research project todevelop a genetically- modified peahas been abandoned after it wasfound to trigger allergic reactionswhen fed to mice. The mice’s lungtissue became inflamed, creatingmucus and affecting their breathing.The reaction was not lifethreatening, according to theresearchers. The gene added to thepea was taken from a strain of beans considered safe for humanconsumption, so the allergicreaction in the mice was surprising.Critics claim the development is aserious blow to supporters ofgenetic modification as it shows thetechnology can have unexpectedand harmful results. ReadingSection three 1274 65A Turkish boy of five has tested positive for the deadly bird flu strain . If Muhammet Ozcan, who iscritically ill, dies, he will be the fourthchild victim from the same town thismonth. His older sister FATMA diedyesterday. While preliminary testsindicated the 12-year-old was notinfected with the deadly H5N1strain, experts still suspect the viruskilled her. The boy caught thedisease after playing with thedecapitated head of an infectedchicken. The World HealthOrganisation believes the Turkishvictims caught the disease fromcontact with infected poultry,in most cases children playing withbirds or helping families kill them forfood. PRICKING the skin for blood-sugar testing is a painful nuisance fordiabetics. American scientist Jack Aronwitz claims to have found theanswer in a patch which draws blood sugar through the pores anddetects sugar levels below the skin surface, which can then be measuredby a small meter from colour changes in the patch. The patch has givengood results in U.S. trials. It should be available here next year .The number of people withinternet access leapt from 7.1million to 18.6 million from 1998to1999. And regular users roseby 48 per cent from 7.5 million to11.5 million, according to a newreport. Users spent an average£170 each on-line with shoppersattracted by big discounts and24-hour shopping .Six out of 10internet users having boughtbooks from firms such asAmazon and BOL.

One word may have different meanings. Read articles 3 and 4 again, look at thedictionary entry for the word ""strain"" and circle its appropriate meaning in eacharticle.Statements True FalseNot mentioned Mobile phones can cause cancer . The boy was contaminated by his sister. Using mobile phones is not dangerous at all. The diabetic patch is very expensive. Melanoma cannot be cured. Genetic modification may be harmful. The sugar level in the blood can be detected by thecolour changes in the patch. Internet shoppers purchase an average of four items ayear . ReadingSection three 129E. Match the words in column A with their definitions in column B. AFTER YOU READ In the following passage, there are 2 irrelevant sentences . Read and cross them out.

True love Part 1 . My name is Joe.That is what my colleague, Milton Davidson, calls me. He is a programmer and I am a computer. I am part of the Multivac-complex and amconnected with other parts all over the world. I know everything. Almost everything. I am Milton’s private computer. I am his Joe. He understands more about computers than anyone in the world, and I am his experimental model. He has made me speakbetter than any other computer can. “ It is just a matter of matching sounds to symbols, Joe,” he told me. “I know the symbols in yours, and I can match them to words, one-to-one”. So I talk. I don’t thinkI talk as well as I think, but Milton says I talk very well. Milton has never married,though he is nearly 40 years old. He has never found the right woman, he told me.""One day"", he said, "" I'll find her yet, Joe. I’m going to find the best. I’m going to havetrue love and you’re going to help me. I’m tired of improving you in order to solve theproblems of the world. Solve my problem. Find me true love.” I said, ""What is true love?"" “Never mind. That is abstract. Just find me the ideal girl. You are connected to the Multivac-complex so you can reach the data banks of every human being in the world.We’ll eliminate them all by groups and classes until we’re left with only one person.The perfect person. She’ll be for me.” 138Arts I said, “ I am ready.” He said, “Eliminate all men first.”It was easy. I could reach out to make contact with the accumulated data on every human being in the world. At his words, I withdrew from 3,784,982,874 men. I keptcontact with 3,786,112,090 women. He gave me exact measurements; he eliminated women with living children; he eliminated women with various genetic characteristics. “ I am not sure about eyecolor,” he said. “ Let that go for a while. But no red hair. I don’t like red hair.” Part 2 . After two weeks, we were down to 235 women. They all spoke English very well. Milton said he didn’t want a language problem. Even computer-translation would getin the way at intimate moments. “ I can’t interview 235 women,” It would take too much time, and people would discover what I am doing.” “ It would make trouble,” I said. Milton had arranged me to do things I wasn’t designated to do. No one knew about that. “ It’s none of their business,” he said, and the skin on his face grew red. Eight were good matches and Milton said, “ Good, you have their banks. Study requirements and needs in the job market and arrange to have them assigned here.One at a time, of course. That is one of the things I am not designated to do. Shifting people from job to job for personal reasons is called manipulation. I wasn’t supposed to do it for anyone buthim, though. The first girl arrived a week later. Milton’s face turned red when he saw her. He spoke as though it were hard to do so. They were together a great deal and he paidno attention to me. One day he said, “ Let me take you to dinner.” The next day he said to me, “ It was no good, somehow. She is a beautiful woman, but I did not feel any touch of true love. Try the next one”. It was the same with all eight. He said, “ I can’t understand it, Joe.” You and I have picked out the eight women who, in all the world, look the best to me.They are ideal.Why don’t they please me?” I said, “ Do you please them?”“ That’s it, Joe. I must be their true love, too, but how do I do it?”He seemed to be thinking all that day. The next morning he came to me and said, “ I’m going to leave it to you, Joe. All up to you. You have my data bank, and I am going to tell you everything about myself.Youfill in my data bank in every possible detail but keep all additions to yourself. Then youwill match it to the 235 women. No, 227. Leave out the eight you’ve seen. Fill up theirdata banks and compare them with mine. Find corrolations.” 139Part 3 . For weeks, Milton talked to me. He told me of his parents and his siblings. He told me of his childhood and his schooling and his adolescence. He told me of the youngwomen he had admired from a distance. He said, “ you see, Joe, as you get moreand more of me in you, I adjust you to match me better and better. You get to thinkmore like me, so you understand me better. If you understand me well enough, thenany woman, whose data bank is something you understand as well, would be my truelove.” He kept talking to me and I came to understand him better and better. I could make longer sentences and my expressions grew more complicated. My speech began to sound a good deal like his in vocabulary, word order and style. I said to him one time, “You see, Milton, it isn’t a matter of fitting a girl to a physical ideal only. You need a girl who is a personal, emotional, temperamental fit to you. Ifthat happens, looks are secondary. If we can’t find the fit in these 227, we’ll lookelsewhere. We will find someone who won’t care how you look either, or how anyonewould look, if only there is the personality fit. What are looks?” “ Absolutely,” he said. “ I would have known this if I had more to do with women in my life. Of course, thinking about it makes it all plain now.” We always agreed; we thought so like each other. “ We shouldn’t have any trouble, now, Milton, if you’ll let me ask you questions. I can see where, in your data bank, there are blank spots and unevenesses.” What followed, Milton said, was the equivalent of a careful psychoanalysis. Of course, I was learning from the psychiatric examinations of the 227 women-on all ofwhich I was keeping close tabs. Part 4 . Milton seemed quite happy. He said, “ Talking to you, Joe, is almost like talking to another self. Our personalities have come to match perfectly”. “ So will the personality of the woman we choose.” For I had found her and she was one of the 227 after all. Her name was Charity Jones and she was an Evaluator at the Library of History in Wichita, Kansas. Her extendeddata bank fit ours perfectly. All the other women had fallen into discard in one respect or another as the data bank grew fuller, but with Charity there was increasing andastonishing resonance. I din’t have to describe her to Milton. Milton had coordinated my symbols so closely with his own I could tell the resonance directly. It fit me. Next it was a matter of adjusting the work sheets and job requirements in such a way as to get Charity assigned to us. It must be done very delicately, so no one would knowthat anything illegal had taken place. Of course, Milton himself knew, since it was he who had arranged it, and that had to be taken care of too. When they came to arrest him on grounds of malfeasance inoffice, it was fortunately, for something that had taken place 10 years ago. He had toldme about it, of course, so it was easy to arrange-and he won’t talk about me for thatwould make his offence much worse.Arts 140A. Who is the narrator? B.

I think genetic engineering should be very controlled. To begin with, life on our planet (has evolved / evolves / evolved) slowly, over thousands of years. If we change that process too quickly by tampering with genes, which are the building (stones / blocks / bricks) of nature, we may cause terrible damage. I worry, furthermore, where scientists will stop if we allow them to ‘play God’ with our world, and whether they (are / have been / will) be able to control the changes they are unleashing. Lastly, we should consider (how / why / when) some governments could use genetics. They (might / must / need to) try to create ""the perfect baby"" or design a ""master-race"". This is a nightmare scenario, of course, but it could happen. In the wrong (heads /hands /eyes) , genetic engineering can be used as a way of playing with nature. Nobody knows what the effects will be if we allow this to go (in / by / on) without strict controls. I think all of us should stop and think (before / while / after) we allow scientists to develop these techniques any further-our survival could dependon it !Activity 3 Activity 4 Put the words in brackets in the right form.

His self-esteem was low. Now Barbara wanted toswitch him to a school for the hearing impaired but school officials resisted herdesire for change. Barbara exercised her right to demand an impartial hearing by the state department of education, which finally decided the boy’s plight was seriousenough to require quick action and ordered the school officials to transferRuss immediately.

People who work in offices are referred to as “ white-collar workers ”. Guess what we call people who do manual work,like mechanics,carpenters,dustmen … D. A good title to the text could be: - The best way to fool a wife.- The stupid wife of Alfred Bloggs.- The double life of Alfred Bloggs. E. If you were in Alf’s position, would you sacrifice a good pay for the benefit of becoming a white-collar worker ? Why ? Why not ?( 1 ) These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than clerks who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as “ whitecollar workers” for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher payfor the privilege of becoming white collar workers. This can give rise to curioussituations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for theEllesmere corporation. ( 2 )When he got married, Alfred was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation . Every morning, he lefthome dressed in a fine black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the nexteight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower andchanged back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kepthis secret. Alf’s wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she neverwill, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office as a juniorclerk. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day andothers will call him “Mr Bloggs ”, not “Alf”. L. G.

Don’t tell off unruly pupils, praise them 1. Teachers were told last night to solve classroom violence by praising disobedient pupils rather than telling them off. Experts argue that the key to controlling disruptivebehaviour is the giving of gentle compliments, which they claim can transform unruly pupils into polite, well-ordered students. “Disciplining an unruly child in front of thewhole class was the worst thing a teacher can do”, the researchers said. “if you wantto motivate any group of people you don’t do it by telling them off, you do it byaccentuating the positives”. 2. Nick Seaton of the Campaign for Real Education said: “This is a ridiculous idea. To heap unearned praise is sending out completely the wrong message. Youngsters needclear guidance on what is right and what is wrong.” 3. Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers’ union said: “ Teachers know that praise can be used to help motivate pupils. But it is far too simplistic to say this is allyou have to do. There are some pupils whose behaviour remains disruptive no matterhow much praise is used.” 4. Dr Swinson said: “ Teachers were good at praising children for good work but rarely praised youngsters for good behaviour. However, they spent a large proportion of theirtime telling pupils off for poor behaviour.” 5. The psychologists devised a training programme called Four Essential Steps to Managing Behaviour. As part of the programme, teachers were asked always to maketheir instructions to the class extremely clear and to look for the behaviour they wantedrather than the behaviour they did not want. The training, which only lasted betweentwo and three hours, showed an important shift in the way teachers spoke to pupils.The most critical finding was that the average percentage of pupils who were doingwhat the teacher wanted them to do under the new system increased to 94 per cent.Dr Swinson said: “It is clear that many teachers, prior to receiving the training wereunaware of the skills needed to deal with unruly classes and over-relied on tellingpupils off, which had very little effect on the pupils’ behaviour. The more praise therewas the fewer kids there were mucking around.” DAILY EXPRESS (January, 2006) ReadingSection three 165Read the text and 1) Tick the correct answer a.

AS YOU READ A . Read the text and find out which of the above predictions it deals with. 193Global warming is human made 1.Findings from a new study released last week prove that global warming is caused by human activity, and not by natural environmental factors. Researchersat the Scripps Institute of Oceanography have found clear evidence of human-produced warming in the world’s oceans that is likely to impact water resources inregions around the globe. These findings remove much of the uncertaintyassociated with debates about global warming. Many world leaders have closedtheir ears to this fact so they don’t have to limit their economic activity or introduceexpensive pollution controls. This is one of the reasons America has not signed theKyoto Treaty on climate change. The US government prefers to believe globalwarming is a natural phenomenon, caused by volcanoes and solar energy. 2.Professor Tim Barnett said, “This is perhaps the most compelling evidence yet that global warming is happening right now and it shows that we cansuccessfully simulate its past and likely future evolution.” Barnett says the resultshold implications for millions of people in the near future. In the decadesimmediately ahead, the changes will be felt in regional water supplies, includingareas impacted by accelerated glacier melting in the South American Andes and inwestern China, putting millions of people at risk without adequate summertimewater. Perhaps now more countries will sign up the Kyoto Protocol. B.

All you had todo was stand at the windowand it passed, like the light, over your face – softer than lightat the edges, the seams,the separations in the glass.All you had to do was stand still in the dark and the room seemed alive with it, crystalline,a bright breath on the air. 200READING A POEMArts Section one III If you fell asleep you knew it could cover you, cover youthe way cold closes on water.It would shine, like ice,inside you.

Eg : That’s the house where I was born. • If who, which orthat is the subject of the relative clause , the pronoun is important and must be kept, but if it is the object, the pronoun may be left out. Eg : He’s the only boy who invited me to play tennis. Have you found the book ( which / that ) you lost ? RELATIVE CLAUSES • Restrictive relative clauses introduce essential information. Eg : The noise that she made woke me up. In restrictive relative clauses that is often used instead of which after superlatives, all, everything, nothing, any(thing), some(thing), none, little,few, much andonly. Eg : That’s the worst play that has ever been performed. The only thing that matters is to tell the truth. If it is the subject, the restrictive pronoun is often left out. Eg : He did everything he could do to help. • Non-restrictive relative clauses give information that can be deleted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. In this case the restrictive clause is placed after a coma. Eg : Ann, whose children are now grown up, is looking for a job. I gave the girl a piece of cake, which she ate immediately. 210 211MUST • It is used to expess obligation or an emphatic advice. Eg : Father: “ You must revise more for the exam” Doctor: “ You must lose weight. Practise sport.” • It can express deduction in the present or the past. Eg : I wonder why Ali hasn’t come to school today. He must be ill. Everything is wet this morning. It must have rained last night. SHOULD Should is used to express advice / recommendation. Eg : You should read this book. It’s very interesting. SHOULD HAVE It is used to express an unfulfilled obligation or a sensible action that didn’t happen. Eg : You should have told him that the paint on the walls was still wet. COMPARISONS Remember Exceptions Important : far, much, many more, a little, a lot can be used before comparatives as modifiers . Eg: far more intelligent / a bit fatter / many more books / much more attractivegood better the best bad worse the worst far farther / further the farthest / the furthest little less the least much / many more the mostComparative Superlative short adjective + er than the + short adjective + est more / less + long adjective than the most / the least + long adjective COMPARISON OF SCALE • Number of times + as + adjective / adverb + as Eg : This house is three times as expensive as that one. • Number of times + as + many / much + as Eg : In some countries women earn half as much as men although they work twice as much. NEEDN’T / NEED TO Needn’t is used to express absence of necessity in the present or the past Eg : * You needn’t send the package by air. You can send it by train. * You needn’t have made such a big cake. Only a few guests came to the party. Need to expresses necessity . It is conjugated as an ordinary verb. Eg : She needs to review the irregular verbs. 212WILL vs BE GOING TO Will + infinitive without to can be used to :• talk about habitual actions Eg : We will come back here next year as usual. • make a promise Eg : I’ll be back home before dark. • make an offer Eg : If you don’t understand the exercise, I’ll explain it to you. • to show that something is expected. Eg : I think summer will be extremely hot this year. Be going to is used to express : • a prior plan Eg : I’m going to spend the week-end by the sea. • Prediction Eg : The car is making strange noises. It’s going to break down. • commands and refusals Eg : You’re going to help with the house chores whether you like it or not. • a permanent state. Eg : Their new house is going to be very beautiful. REPORTING QUESTIONS We start an indirect question with a verb like ask, inquire, wonder, want to know . • If the indirect question starts with a question word ( who, what, where ...), the question word is repeated . Eg : “ What do you want?” He asked them what they wanted. • If there is no question word, ifor whether must be used. Eg : “ Is anyone here?” He wanted to know if anyone was there. Remember : When the reporting verb is in the past we change the tenses as follows. Direct Questions Indirect Questions Simple present Simple Past Present Continuous Past Continuous Present Perfect Past Perfect Past Progressive Past Perfect Progressive Future Conditional. 213arise awakebebearbeatbecomebeginbendbereavebetbitebleedblowbreakbreedbringbroadcastbuildburnburstbuycastcatchchooseclingcomecostcreepcutdealdigdodrawdreamdrinkdriveeatfallfeedfeelfightflyforgetarose awokewas / wereborebeatbecamebeganbentbereaved / bereftbetbitbledblewbrokebredbroughtbroadcastbuiltburnt / burnedburstboughtcastcaughtchoseclungcamecostcreptcutdealtdugdiddrewdreamt / dreameddrankdroveatefellfedfeltfoughtflewforgotarisen awoke beenbornbeatenbecomebegunbentbereaved / bereftbetbittenbledblownbrokenbredbroughtbroadcastbuilt burnt / burned burstboughtcastcaughtchosenclungcomecostcreptcutdealtdugdonedrawndreamt / dreameddrunkdriveneatenfallenfedfeltfoughtflownforgotten IRREGULAR VERBS Infinitive Simple Past Past Participle 214forgive freezegetgivegogrowhanghavehearhidehitholdhurtkeepknowlayleadlearnleavelendletlielightlosemakemeanmeetmistakepayputreadrideringriserunsayseeseekforgave frozegotgavewentgrewhunghadheardhidhitheldhurtkeptknewlaidledlearnt / learnedleftlentletlaylitlostmademeantmetmistookpaidputreadroderangroseransaidsawsoughtforgiven frozengotgivengonegrownhunghadheardhiddenhitheldhurtkeptknownlaidledleant / learnedleftlentletlainlitlostmademeantmetmistakenpaidputreadriddenrungrisenrunsaidseensought Infinitive Simple Past Past Participle 215sell sendsetshakeshineshootshowshrinkshutsingsinksitsleepsmellspeakspeedspellspoilspreadstandstealstickstrikestriveswearsweepswimtaketeachteartellthinkthrowunderstandundergounwindwakewearweavewinwithdrawwritesold sentsetshookshoneshotshowedshrankshutsangsanksatsleptsmelt / smelledspokespedspeltspoiltspreadstoodstolestuckstruckstrovesworesweptswamtooktaughttoretoldthoughtthrewunderstoodunderwentunwoundwokeworewovewonwithdrewwrotesold sentsetshakenshoneshotshownshrunkshutsungsunksatsleptsmelt / smelledspokenspedspeltspoiltspreadstoodstolenstuckstruckstrivenswornsweptswumtakentaughttorntoldthoughtthrownunderstoodundergoneunwoundwokenwornwovenwonwithdrawnwritten Infinitive Simple Past Past Participle 216PHONETIC SYMBOLS Short Vowel Sounds: Red box b us c at river book s ix Long vowel sounds : Three moon g irl c ar moree i: here ei ght p oor boy throw there mynow eIeI ai aI Diphthongs : Triphthongs : / f ire / flower a::cIc e u::e Consonants : p k b d d1 g f θ s ∫ v a z 1 m n n h l r w jt t∫Ieeau e ΩeΩ Ωe aae^ eΩa pen ten tea cher kick ball doll an gel god fine three stop pu sh voice this zero mea sure monday night ki ng h ello listen read white yes"

3PREFACE
' Skills for Life ' is a book for students in Year 4 Secondary Education. It
addresses all students in various streams through a common core of lessons, withadditional material for the Arts students to be covered in the two weekly extrahours. These are labelled : For Arts Students. 
The book is made up of an  Introductory Unit, 4 nine-lesson Units and 3
Consolidation Units (Checking Year 3,Check your Language and Skills 1&2)with a last section entitled ADD-ONS including a Grammar Reference,
V ocabulary strategies, Irregular Verbs and a Word List  .
The units are based on all  four language skills  which are developed in an
integrated  manner .This skills blend is  reflected in the use of INTO in the lesson
titles which are labelled :Speaking INTO Reading , Listening INTO Writing,Reading INTO Writing, Speaking INTO Listening.
This skill integration takes students from the construction of meaning through
listening and reading passages to communicating in speech and writing. 
The listening and reading texts are exploited for information and linguistic
content and serve as a springboard for production. They come from differentsources: novels, magazines, newspapers, ads, leaflets, poems, songs, plays… tosensitize students to different genres.
The learner is led to construct knowledge and learn how to reinvest it in a range
of situations  that relate to real life.
Activities range from group work and pair work to webquests and
projects .The integration of Information Communication Technology and the
development of personal projects  foster students'  autonomy and creativity beyondthe classroom .
Students are also engaged in using various sources of information such as
dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms, thesauruses and the Internet.
Language is not only a means of communication to interact with others
inside and outside the classroom but it is also handled as a system . Language
components are presented in meaningful contexts and recycled at various levelsof complexity. Grammar is dealt with inductively to get the students to reflect on
language and how it works. Pronunciation is also given due importance througha variety of activities  that allow  further practice of sounds, word stress andintonation. 
Practice of linguistic items is catered for in the  Grammar Focus ,Lexical
Focus and  Pronunciation Focus sections included within the lessons. 
Three  permanent components are to be found at the end of  each lesson : My
New Words, My Grammar andWHAT I CAN DO NOW.
4After  completing two units, students are  provided with a set of activities
labelled as 'Check your Language and Skills' for  further  practice  of the
language acquired and  a better skills  development.
Portfolios are  used by students to keep track of their progress through
creating vocabulary files,  various pieces of writing , summaries of  texts  orstories , poems and  a selection of information they  get through Webquests .
We hope the implementation of the official syllabus has been carried out
successfully and that students will engage in enjoyable learning and  acquire abetter mastery of the language  which will enable them to pursue learning for lifeusing  skills and strategies that shape the profile of the autonomous learner.

there was (plenty – any - a lot of) turbulence in our society. We lived in an African-American,
rather (depressing – depressive – depressed) community. It didn’t stop her. She made it
(clearly – unclear – clear) to us that we were headed for bigger things.
Now I’m the mother of three sons and I think women who juggle high (powered – powering

organization and prioritization. All of those are good things. It also (inquires – requires –
acquires) a lot of family support because there are times when you’ve got a one-body

29English is spoken as a first language by several countries
including Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,Canada, and the United States.  While all of these countriesshare the same mother tongue, there are some differences inthe way they speak and write.  The first difference is in the accent.  Each country has its ownaccent. And within each country there are a variety of accentscalled regional accents.  
Another difference is the spelling of some words, like color andcolour, or theater and theatre.  
And a third difference is that some of the words are not the same at all.  For example,
Americans say restroom, Canadians say washroom, and the British say W.C. (water
closet.)  But all of these words have the same meaning (the room where the toilet islocated.)

4.Refer back to your answers to Question 7 above and say what changes  or

The competition for space tourists is playing out in China as well as the United
States, with rival companies signing up well-to-do customers for future flights.The face-off has as much to do with winning a foothold in the world's biggestpotential market as well as achieving another first in the annals of spaceflight.
More than a year ago, Virginia-based Space Adventures announced that Hong
Kong-based businessman Jiang Feng was paying $100,000 to take a suborbitalpassenger flight aboard an unspecified spaceship that has yet to be built. Nowan adviser to British-based Virgin Galactic says a businessman from eastern
China's Zhejiang province will be among the first 100 passengers for Virgin'sSpaceship Two suborbital rocket plane. 
Like Space Adventures, Virgin Galactic is one of the leaders in the emerging
space tourism industry. The Shanghai adviser, Rupert Hoogewerf, told Reutersthat the businessman has paid Virgin's $200,000 fare for the flight package.Hoogewerf said the man was under 40 and had asked for his identity to be keptsecret.
Jiang as well as Virgin's mystery client are competing for the title of ""first
Chinese space tourist"" — but it's not yet clear which one will fly first. VirginGalactic, owned by British billionaire Richard Branson, has said it will begintaking on passengers in the 2008-2009 time frame. Its rocket plane is designedto carry six passengers and two pilots on 2.5-hour flights to the edge of space.Virgin's first spaceflights would take off from Mojave, California, with a move toNew Mexico's future spaceport planned for 2009-2010.
43Space Adventures, meanwhile, has forged agreements with a variety of
spaceship developers — including a deal with the Russian Federal SpaceAgency and the Prodea Venture capital firm reportedly aimed at beginningsuborbital tourism service in the next couple of years. However, SpaceAdventures' time frame has shifted over the past couple of years. Last year,the company projected that Jiang would be able to fly in 2007.
Since 2001, Space Adventures has arranged for four private-sector space
passengers to take orbital trips to the international space station, at anestimated cost of $20 million each.

Make music sweet;
Strings by the river where

79TThe Winter's Tale Part 1 
Leontes, king of Sicily, and his queen, the beautiful and good
Hermione once lived in the greatest happiness together. Leonteswas so happy in the love of this excellent lady that he had nothingleft to wish for, except that he sometimes wanted to see again, andto present to his queen, his old companion and school-fellow,Polixenes, king of Bohemia.
Leontes and Polixenes had been brought up together from the time
when they were children, but, after the death of their fathers, eachone had to rule his own kingdom, and so they had not met for manyyears, though they often exchanged gifts, letters and lovingmessages.
At last, after many invitations, Polixenes came from Bohemia to the Sicilian court, to
make a visit to his friend Leontes.
At first, this visit gave nothing but pleasure to Leontes. He begged the queen to give this
friend of his youth her special care and attention and seemed to have his happiness quitecompleted when he was with his old companion. They talked about old times; theyremembered their schooldays and their youthful games. They told stories of these toHermione, who always took a cheerful part in these conversations.
After a long stay, Polixenes was preparing to leave when Hermione, at her husband's
wish, begged him to make his visit longer.
And now, this good queen's sorrow began. Polixenes had refused to stay when
Leontes asked him but Hermione's gentle words persuaded him to do so. At this,although Leontes had so long known the honesty of his friend Polixenes as well as theexcellent character of his good queen, he was seized with an uncontrollable jealousy.Everything that Hermione did for Polixenes, although it was done only to please herhusband, increased the unfortunate king's jealousy. Suddenly, Leontes changed from atrue friend, and the best and  most loving of husbands, into a wild and evil creature. Hesent for Camillo, one of the lords of his court, and told him of his suspicions about hiswife's unfaithfulness. Then he ordered him to poison Polixenes.
Camillo was a good man. He knew well that there  was no truth in what Leontes
suspected, and so, instead of poisoning Polixenes, he told him of his master's orders andagreed to escape with him from Sicily. Thus Polixenes, with the help of Camillo, arrivedsafely in his own kingdom of Bohemia. From that time, Camillo lived in the king's courtand became the chief friend and favourite of Polixenes.
The escape of Polixenes made the jealous Leontes still more angry. He went to the
queen's room where her little son Mamillius was just beginning to tell one of his beststories to amuse her. Taking the child away, the king sent Hermione to prison. 

80Though Mamillius was only a very young
child he loved his mother dearly. When he sawher treated so shamefully and knew that she hadbeen taken away from him to be put into prison,he became very unhappy. Gradually, he lost hisdesire to eat and sleep until it was thought thathis sadness would kill him.
When the king had sent his queen to prison,
he commanded Cleomenes and Dion, twoSicilian lords, to go to Delphos and ask theoracle at the temple of Apollo if his queen hadbeen unfaithful to him.

Hermione had a kind and noble-spirited friend, Paulina, who was the wife of
Antigonus, a Sicilian lord. When Paulina heard that the queen had given birth to a child,she went to the prison where Hermione was kept and said to Emilia, a lady who servedHermione, “I pray you, Emilia, tell the good queen that if she will trust me with her littlebaby, I will carry it to the king, its father. We do not know how his heart may soften whenhe sees his little child.”
“Most noble lady,” replied Emilia, “I will tell the queen of your offer. She was wishing
today that she had a friend who would dare to present the child to the king.”
“And tell her,” said Paulina, “that I will speak bravely
to  Leontes in her defence.”
“May you be for ever blessed,” said Emilia, “for your
kindness to our gentle queen!""
Emilia then went to Hermione who joyfully gave up
her baby to the care of Paulina.
Paulina took the child and forced herself into the
presence of the king, although her husband, who fearedthe king's  anger, tried to prevent her. 
She laid the baby at its father's feet, and made a noble speech to the king in defence
of Hermione. She blamed him for his cruelty and begged him to have pity on his innocentwife and child. But her words only increased Leontes' anger, and he ordered her husbandAntigonus to take her away.
When Paulina went away, she left the little baby at its father’s feet She thought that,
when he was alone with it, he would look at it, and have pity on its innocence.
The good Paulina was wrong. No sooner had she gone than the pitiless father ordered
Antigonus to take the child out to sea and leave it on some empty shore to die.
Antigonus was not like the good Camillo. He obeyed the orders of Leontes too well.
He carried the child on to a ship at once and sailed out to sea, intending to leave it onthe first lonely shore that he could find.“THE WINTER’S TALE”  
PART 2For Arts Students 1:  Session 1
83The king was so sure that Hermione was guilty that he would not wait for the return
of Cleomenes and Dion from Delphos. Before the queen had recovered from herweakness, and from her misery at losing her precious baby, she was brought to a publictrial before all the lords and nobles of his court. When all the great lords and judges weregathered together to try Hermione, and while that unhappy lady was standing as aprisoner to receive their judgment, Cleomenes and Dion entered, and gave the king theanswer of the oracle.
Leontes commanded that the words of the oracle should be read aloud, and these were
the words:
“Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true servant, Leontes a jealous
and cruel king, and he shall live without an heir unless that which was lost is found.”
The king would not believe the words of the oracle. He said that it was a lie made up
by the queen's friends, and he asked the judge to go on with the trial of the queen. Whilehe was speaking, however, a man entered and told him that the prince, Mamillius,hearing that his mother was to be tried for her life, had been struck with grief andshame, and had suddenly died.
When Hermione heard of the death of this dear and loving child who had lost his life
because of his grief at her misfortune, she fainted. Leontes himself was filled with miseryby the news and began to feel pity for his unhappy queen. He ordered Paulina to takeher away and help her to recover. Paulina soon returned, and told the king that Hermionewas dead.
When Leontes heard that the queen was dead, he felt deeply sorry for all his cruelty to
her. Now that he thought his ill-treatment had broken Hermione's heart, he believed herto be innocent. Now also he thought the words of the oracle were true. He knew that “ifthat which was lost is not found” (which he believed to be his young daughter), he wouldbe without an heir, as the young prince Mamillius was dead; and he would have givenhis kingdom to recover his lost daughter. With such sad thoughts as these, Leontespassed many years in grief and sorrow.

B
Some students believe that e-learning must be easier because they do not have to goto a classroom.
C
Online learning ,like all learning, requires a commitment of time. If you don’t have
enough time, you can make more time. Some options are sleeping  less, …….? ….. , …….?……,  ……….? ………., ………..? …………and so on.

Primary and Secondary education is compulsory for students
between the ages of 6 and 16 and is a right until 18. Moststudents start at age 5 and remain in school for the full 18years. The last   2 years of primary are normally consideredintermediate school, leaving primary school to end at year 6.Secondary school is  the remaining 5 years of schooling.

Education in primary schools focuses on
the basic skills of reading, writing andmaths. Children spend most of the daywith a class teacher and they havespecialist teachers for subjects such asMusic and French. The subject areas ofGeography, History, Science, Art,Drama, Design and Technology aresometimes drawn together in themes ortopics.At secondary level children are taught by
subject teachers. Up to the age of 14,secondary schools give a broad, balancededucation. From 14 to 16 pupils are taught ingroups that relate to the subjects and levelsfor their GCSE (General Certificate of
Secondary Education). The first 3 years
focus on studies that must include the three“core” subjects of mathematics, English andScience in addition to the 7 “foundation”subjects of technology, history, geography, aforeign language, art, music and physicaleducation.
104The National Curriculum is divided into four “Key Stages”, which broadly relate to pupils’
ages: KS1 from five to seven KS2 from seven to eleven, KS3 from eleven to fourteen, KS4from fourteen to sixteen. The National Curriculum specifies what children must study andwhat they are expected to know at different ages.

School of the Air
Being vast, Australia is often isolated with remote communities. Children are sometimes
thousands of kilometres from the nearest school. Australia’s belief in education for alldemanded a solution to this problem, and teachers conceived a plan to use the radionetwork to reach children living in the remote homes. The first school of the Air opened forclass in 1951. The radio remains an integral part of the school, however, newertechnologies such as satellites, the internet, telephone and fax are also used whereavailable, in addition to the postal service.

School where pupils will be taught according to …………………… 
instead of age
A SECONDARY school is to become the
first state school in England to teach all its
pupils according to their ability rather than
their age.
(A)
Pupils at Bridgemary School in Gosport,
Hampshire, will be taught in mixed-age
classes from September under the radical
initiative to boost standards.For each subject they will be assessed via testsand teacher judgments then allocated to one offive levels, depending on their ability.
(B)
'Children get bored or their behaviour can get
challenging if they are not being pushed because
the levels within class are too different.'
Mrs. Heron, 50, took over at Bridgemary
three years ago. It has 1,100 pupils aged 11to 16 and is in a deprived urban area.
Shortly after her arrival, Bridgemary was
classed by schools watchdog Ofsted as
having 'serious weaknesses' with most pupilsfailing to gain five good GCSEs.
Mrs. Heron said the new 'personalised
learning' system was aimed at tackling the
culture of under-achievement. She added:
“We have got to find a way to change thisculture and I am of the opinion that thenormal class system does not seem to beworking.”The five levels are access, entry, level one,
level two and level three. Access deals with 
basic numeracy and literacy, while level three isequivalent to A-levels.
The school tested the plan when it transformed
traditional tutor groups into mixed age 'learning groups'.
Mrs. Heron - described by Ofsted as an
'excellent leader who was driving the school
forward' - said no problems had been found with
having older and younger children together.
The school's plan for a total switch to classes
based on ability reflects the resurgence in
support for differentiating by ability, which wasonce condemned as anti-comprehensive.
(C)
It is estimated that 60 per cent of secondary
schools employ some form of streaming but
experts say the level of personalised learning
Bridgemary plans is unheard of.
Dr. Faysal Mikdadi, chairman of governors at
Bridgemary and an Ofsted inspector, said: “A lotof people will say we are moving away from the
comprehensive ideal. I don't think that is true
and anyway I could not care less about an ideal.
'I care about whether these children are
achieving their potential.”
The scheme is being monitored by the local
authority and Ofsted.

1. Discuss the following.
‘Adult education must not be regarded as a luxury for a few exceptional persons here and
there, nor as a thing which concerns only a short span of early manhood. It is a permanentnational necessity, an inseparable aspect of citizenship, and therefore should be bothuniversal and lifelong.’What do YOU think?

appropriate headings.
A. The learner's experience is paramount
B. Adult education should not be only professionalC. Education is for life D. We should start with interests and needs
'Education is not merely preparation for an
unknown kind of future living. The whole oflife is learning, therefore education canhave no endings. This new venture iscalled adult education not because it isconfined to adults but because adulthood,
maturity, defines its limits.'Education revolves about non-vocational
ideals. Adult education more accuratelydefined begins where vocational educationleaves off. Itspurpose is to put meaning
into the whole of life'.
'The approach. will be via the route of situations, not subjects. In conventional educationthe student is required to adjust himself to an established curriculum; in adult education the
curriculum is built around the student's needs and interests'.

Three key features stand out of the accounts of lifelong education:
Last, it rests on the belief that individuals are, or can become, self-directing, and that they willsee the value in engaging in lifelong education. Then, it extends beyond the formaleducational providers to encompass all agencies, groups and individuals involved in any kindof learning activity. First, lifelong education is seen as building upon and affecting all existingeducational providers, including both schools and institutions of higher education.

118AALEXANDER 
GRAHAM BELL, THE….Lesson 9
READING INTO WRITING
1. Check your reading rate.
You are going to read a 6-paragraph text about Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the
telephone.Take 1 minute to read as much as you can of the text.
Stop after one minute sharp .
Count the words you managed to read.
What is your reading speed ?
Has it improved compared to your score  when you read the biographical notes about Sting
in the Introductory Unit ?
Go round the class and find out about your classmates’ reading rate.What is the average number of words other students managed to read in one minute?
2. Once you have read the text,complete the title with ONEword (other than
inventor).
He was “troubled all his life by the timeless and universal human need to communicate,”
says a biographer of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. And it wasnot alone through his invention but even more, perhaps, as a teacher of speech, thatAlexander Graham Bell pursued that goal. He would rather be remembered as a teacherof the deaf, he told his family, than as the inventor of the telephone. And what a teacher hewas! — enthusiastic, innovative, sympathetic, creative.
Alexander Graham Bell’s family were no strangers to the communicative arts. His
grandfather, for whom he was named, was a well-known elocutionist and actor inEdinburgh Scotland, where the younger Alexander was born on March 3, 1847. In additionto giving public lectures and dramatic readings, the elder Bell developed a considerablepractice in the treatment of speech defects, such as stammering, lisping, and otherimpediments. He wrote two books, Stammering and other Impediments of Speech and ThePractical Elocutionist, which used comma-like symbols to indicate word grouping andemphasis.
In his middle teens, young Alec, as he was called, spent a year with his grandfather, who
was at that time living in London. This experience had a lasting influence on his life, and itgave him a maturity and seriousness of purpose that made him seem in some waysconsiderably older than his years.1.
2.
1193. Bell’s father, Alexander Melville Bell, gained a worldwide reputation as a teacher of
correct speech and lecturer on elocution. When only a young man he began investigatingthe working of the vocal organs.  Melville Bell, like his father, studied the anatomy ofspeech and approached his subject with scientific thoroughness. In 1864, 
he completed a universally applicable phonetic alphabet by which he could describe the
manner of production of the sounds of nearly all known languages. He called this alphabet
“Visible Speech” and its various symbols (thirty-four in all) showed how the vocal organswould be positioned to make a sound.
4.Alec and his brothers became quite adept at using the “Visible Speech’ alphabet,
reading the symbols and producing the sounds they represented. In demonstrations,linguists from various parts of the world dictated words to Melville Bell from a number ofdifferent “exotic” languages, dialects and accents (including American Indian languagesArabic, Hindi, Persian, Urdu, and many more), and his sons produced the sounds from thesymbols their father had written down . Their performance was impressive, and acommentary in the London Illustrated Times proclaimed: “We cannot pretend even toguess at the horizons opened up by such an alphabet in the training of the deaf, the
dumb, and the blind.”
5.Alec’s mother was a musician as well as an accomplished portrait painter, and her
son was born with such a talent for music that from infancy he could play by ear andimprovise at the piano. He was therefore given an extensive musical education and for ashort while planned a musical career. He in fact did teach music for two years at a boys’school. When he was about twelve years old, his mother lost her hearing; and there is littledoubt that this misfortune intensified his sympathy for the deaf and his lifelong interest inhelping to alleviate their difficulties in communicating.
6.In the summer of 1868, Melville Bell went on a lecture tour in the United States and
Canada, leaving his son in full charge of his practice in London, where Alec also continuedhis studies at the university. When his father returned, Alec became a full partner in thework, continuing to teach while he studied the anatomy of the vocal apparatus at LondonUniversity. His work met with great success, and his reputation flourished. The work he didrevealed his outstanding talent for teaching.

MICHAEL  FOSTER
1. Read the story and place these headings relating to the different parts 
in the space provided.
A. ________________
It’s queer, the things you remember. When life has crumbled suddenly, and left you
standing there, alone. It’s not the big important things that you remember when you come tothat: not the plans of years, not the love nor the hopes you’ve worked so hard for. It’s the littlethings that you remember then: the little things you hadn’t noticed at the time. The way ahand touched yours, and you too busy to notice; the hopeful little inflection of a voice youdidn’t really bother to listen to…
John Carmody found that out, staring through the living-room window at the cheerful
Tuesday-afternoon life of the street. He kept trying to think about the big, important things,lost now — the years and the plans, and the hopes. And the love. But he couldn’t quite get themfocused sharply in his mind, just now. Not this  afternoon.          
They, those important things, were like a huge but nebulous background in his mind. All
he could remember, now, was a queer little thing: nothing, really, if you stopped and thoughtabout it in the light of the years and the plans and the — the great love. It was only somethinghis little girl had said to him. One evening, two — perhaps three weeks ago. Nothing, if you
looked at it rationally. The sort of thing that kids are always saying.
But it was what he was remembering, now.
B. ________________
That particular night, he had brought home from the office a finished draft of the annual
stockholders’ report. Very important, it was. Things being as they were, it meant a great deal—to his future; to the future of his wife and his little girl. He sat down to reread it before dinner.It had to be right: it meant so much.                                         
And just as he turned a page, Marge, his little girl, came with a book under her arm. It was a
green-covered book, with a fairy-tale picture pasted on it. And she said: “Look, Daddy.” a)Development of the drama
b) Setting the scene for the story
c) Conclusion
d) Focus on the story 
e) Introducing the main characters, setting events in motionEXTENSIVE READING For Arts Students : Session 3
He glanced up and said: “Oh, fine. A new book, eh?”  
“Yes, Daddy,” she said. “Will you read me a story in it?”“No, dear. Not just now,” he said.
Marge just stood there, and he read through the report. And Marge’s voice, with timid and
hopeful little inflections, was saying: “But Mummy said you probably would, Daddy.”
He looked up over the top of the typescript. “I’m sorry,"" he answered. “May be Mummy will
read it to you. I’m busy, Dear.”
“No,” Marge said politely. “Mummy is much busier, upstairs. Won’t you read me just this one
story? Look— it has a picture. See? Isn’t it a lovely picture, Daddy?” 
“Oh, yes. Beautiful,” he said. “Now, that picture has class, hasn’t it? But I do have to work
tonight. Some other time…”
After that, there was quite a long silence. Marge just stood there, with the book open at
the lovely picture. It was a long time before she said anything else. He read through two morepages…
“But it is a lovely picture, Daddy. And the story looks so exciting,” Marge said.“I know,” he said. “Ah…mmmmmmm. Some other time. Run along, now.”               “I’m sure you’d enjoy it, Daddy,” Marge said.“Eh? Yes, I know I would. But later.”“Oh,” Marge said. “Well, some other time, then. Will you, Daddy? Some other time?”“Oh, of course,” he said.
But she didn’t go away. She still stood there quietly, like a good child. And after a long
time, she put the book down on the chair, and said:
“Well, whenever you get ready, just read it to yourself. Only read it loud enough so I can
hear, too.”
“Sure,” he said. “Sure. Later.”
C. ________________
And that was what John Carmody was remembering. Now. Not the long plans of love and
care for the years ahead. He was remembering the way a well-mannered child had touchedhis hand with timid little fingers, and said:
“Just read it to yourself. Only read it loud enough so I can hear, too.”
And that was why, now, he put his hand on the book. From the corner table where they had
piled some of Marge’s playthings, picking them up from the floor where she had left them.
The book wasn’t new any more, and the green cover was dented and thumbed. He opened
it to the lovely picture. 
125
126And reading that story, his lips moving stiffly with anguish to form the words, he didn’t try
to think any more, as he should be thinking, about the important things: about his careful andshrewd and loving plans for years to come; and for a little while he forgot, even, the horror andbitterness of his hate for the half-drunken punk kid who had carelessly driven  down the streetin a second-hand car — and who was now in jail on manslaughter charges.  
DD. ________________
He didn’t even see his wife, white and silent, dressed for Marge’s funeral, standing in the doorway, trying to make her voice say calmly: “I’m ready, dear. We must go.”
Because John Carmody was reading:
“Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a woodcutter’s hut, in the Black Forest.
And she was so fair that the birds forgot their singing from the bough, looking at her. And
there came a day when…”
He was reading it to himself. But loud enough for her to hear, too. Maybe.

1. Read the introduction and complete the table.
Who? What ? Where ?
Hoda Baraka , age 23 from Cairo, is studying an MSc in politics of the
world economy at the London School of Economics (LSE) economy at theLondon School of Economics (LSE) 
1.London universities' reputation for academic excellence is what most
attracts foreign students to the capital, particularly those pursuinggraduate studies. As someone who completed an undergraduate degreeat an American university, then did postgraduate studies at the LSE, I
can attest to the strengths of the British system.
2.While the US system exposes students to a wide range of subjects, the British system
focuses more on building a solid base for critical thinking. This approach has proved tobe more fulfilling for graduate students - in the UK they are assessed more on thestrength and eloquence of their arguments, rather than on how much information theyhave absorbed.
3.The vibrancy of London life also features highly for most graduate students, and
many universities highlight this when attempting to attract overseas students. Theexposure to different cultures and mindsets is matched by few universities in otherworld capitals.
4.Although most UK universities emphasise that their graduate programmes are only
one year - an important advantage over their American counterparts - more studentsare considering part-time study, in view of the severe time constraints on full-timestudents. This enables them to take part in the many other activities that university lifeoffers. 
5.However, there is a more important issue, which in my view is likely to dissuade an
overseas student from studying in the UK: the financial outlay. The availability ofscholarships for international students is limited. Many fewer university scholarships aregiven to overseas students in Britain than in the US. These financial constraints reducethe pool of foreign students. This is a sad loss for the cultural diversity of university life
6.As someone who has been exposed to the American and British educational systems,
the British system was more fulfilling and enlightening. But the financial headaches ofstudying here must be addressed if international students are to continue to choose theUK.

Privacy Fears Intensified By Tech That Knows Where You Are
As location-based technology advances, your computer, cell phone, and other mobile
devices may soon be able to identify and transmit your exact place as you travel. And
developers hope that an expanding network will tie these devices together to create a unique
new user experience. People tapped into this new web will be able to communicate
immediately with nearby users, participate in digital community activities, and get advertising
for businesses that are exactly around the corner. But even in its babyhood , the concept of
an electronic network that can track and communicate a person's every move is raising a
number of questions about user privacy. Indeed, these techniques can be very disturbing .
To always know where someone is, is more information than most employers are entitled to.
The big question is, astechnology advances, does privacy diminish?""

The iPod : Any Future?
Yes, the omnipresent music player is a powerful force. But
what comes next?
1.The iPod, including the latest video version is a digital media
phenomenon. But issues like digital rights management could stem that
tide.
It's been quite an autumn for the iPod: the fifth anniversary celebration, the ultra-small gigabyte
Shuffle, the iTunes Latino store and finally the ultimate iPod accessory. [……] But the question is:what comes after the iPod?
2.The impact of the iPod on media has been astonishing - and not only on the music world.  Five
years ago who could have predicted that a handheld digital media player would be able to shift the
fortunes of primetime network programming?
3.Five years from now, however, the iPod ecology must grow beyond the handheld realm and
inhabit the larger context in which we consume media; what the industry generically calls “the living
room.”  But there are some major issues to confront between now and then, many of them growing
out of the key element that made the iPod successful in the first place: The iPod's designer's iron-fisted control of hardware, software and content sales. 
4.[……]* A final troublesome issue awaits the iPod future: users have grown accustomed to
hearing CD-quality and DVD surround sound on their living room systems.  Will compressed iPod
files sound a bit thin by comparison?  It is thought that for some people it won't make a difference,
but for others there may be a “semi-orphaning of the tracks you've already bought.

TO OPT OUTLesson 5
READING INTO WRITING
1. The following scrambled paragraphs make up an argumentative article. Reorder
them so as to get  a main thesis, 3 supporting arguments and a conclusion.
Number each paragraph and label it. *See the sample answer provided.
Paragraph N°……….
Women used to be willing to devote their time, energy, and effort to the
corporation's needs-at the expense of meeting their own professional goals. But notanymore. They're starting their own businesses in an effort to gain more freedom,recognition, money, opportunities and other rewards.  According to the Center forWomen's Business research, the number of women-owned U.S. businesses grew attwice the rate of all firms between 1997 and 2002.
Paragraph N°……….
Expanding opportunities for women in leadership will require corporate
change, as well as accommodations on the part of women themselves. Corporatecultures must support initiatives such as giving women high-visibility assignments,making gender diversity a part of succession planning and holding managersaccountable for women's advancements. While women managers can improve theirleadership ability by seeking out risky, high profile assignments. They should also tryto strengthen their leadership skills in order to meet new challenges.
Paragraph N°……….
Experts say corporate America isn't doing enough to keep women from walking
out the door. Companies need to focus on providing flexibility, as well as continuingchallenges and opportunities for personal growth, to retain women whom they viewas high-potential or who are already significant contributors. It is essential that acompany should identify potential women managers early in their careers, rewardtheir contribution and five them grand positions.
156
**Paragraph N°1: Main thesis  (  SAMPLE ANSWER)
Increasingly, women managers are choosing to ""opt out"" when corporations fail
to meet their professional needs. Opting out-the latest catch phrase within corporatecircles-describes the growing trend of leaving corporate positions for alternativecareer paths. A significant number of women managers are leaving large companies tostart their own businesses. In fact, women are quitting corporate jobs in favor ofentrepreneurship at twice the rate of men, according to Cheskin, a strategic marketresearch and consulting company. 
Paragraph N°……….
Fifty-one percent of women business owners with prior private-sector
experience cite the desire for more flexibility as the major reason for leaving corporatepositions, according to a study by Catalyst, a non-profit research and advisoryorganization working to advance professional women. Twenty-nine percent saidrestrictive glass-ceiling issues drove them out the door. Of those women, 44 % felttheir contributions were not recognized or valued.

How Extensive Is the Brain Drain?
Many scientists, engineers, physicians, and other professionals from developing
countries work in Canada, the United States, and Western Europe. This phenomenon, oftenreferred to as the ""brain drain,"" was noticed as early as the 1960s and has been acontentious issue in the North-South debate ever since. One important implication of thebrain drain is that investment in education in a developing country may not lead to fastereconomic growth if a large number of its highly educated people leave the country. Also,efforts to reduce specific skill shortages through improved educational opportunities may belargely futile unless measures are taken to offset existing incentives for highly educatedpeople to emigrate.

3.Do you think human migration is inevitable?
TEXT B
International Migration: Brain Drain or Brain Gain?
The World Bank estimates that higher rates of international migration are inevitable:
the phenomenon is a result of demographic trends that create a high demand for certainforms of labor in the developed world and a high supply of that labor in developing nations,and of declining communication and transportation costs. Moreover, international migrationis desirable: developed nations can hope to profit from a ""brain gain"" opposite the developingworld's ""brain drain,"" while developing nations enjoy the economic network benefits that theirexpatriates send home. It is important, reports the World Bank, that developed anddeveloping nations improve their cooperation on the issue-especially so that developingnations are not unnecessarily hurt by a brain drain of skilled workers. Neither group canhope to stop international migration, but, if they play their cards right, both can hope tobenefit from it.

164RReverse Brain Drain: A Loss or A Gain?
Africans swim against the brain drain tide. They left Africa in search of opportunity, to
escape political persecution or to build a better life for their children.They thrive as they enjoytheir full rights in their homeland. But, sometimes after decades spent as immigrants orrefugees in the rich countries of the West, growing numbers of Africans are beginning tobring their expertise, talent and hopes for the future home to the world's poorest continent.
Across the continent, returning African emigrants are filling key positions in government,
education and business in a slow ""reverse brain drain"" that is gathering pace and thatofficials hope will sow the seeds of a broader economic revival. Returning Africans havemany reasons for coming home. But chief among them appears to be the chance tocontribute to countries that badly need their skills.

Egyptian-American scientist Ahmed H. Zewail won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for
showing that a rapid laser technique can observe the motion of atoms in a molecule duringa chemical reaction. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Zewail was being honored for a revolution inchemistry through ""his pioneering investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, usingultra- short laser flashes, on the time-scale on which the reactions actually occur."" Theacademy said Zewail's work
in the late 1980s led to the birth of femtochemistry, the use of
high-speed cameras to monitor chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or0.000000000000001 of a second. 
'No chemical reactions take place faster'
""We have reached the end of the road. No chemical reactions take place faster than this,""
the academy said. ""We can now see the movements of individual atoms as we imagine them.They are no longer invisible,"" the academy said. Zewail's technique, using what could be described as the world's fastest camera, worksmuch the same way as slow-motion action replays - they enable viewers to watch a footballmatch in detail. Applications of this technique include the design of molecular electroniccomponents, the study of the most delicate mechanisms in life processes and the productionof the medicines of the future, the academy said. 
A U.S. and Egyptian citizen, Zewail has held the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena since 1990.

1.Who did James Hillier share the credit for inventing the electron microscope with?
James Hillier, who shared the credit for inventing the electron microscope, died Monday
at age 91.
Hillier and another student, Albert Prebus, invented the microscope under the guidance of
Professor Eli Burton while they were at the University of Toronto in 1938.The microscopemagnified objects 7,000 times their actual size, more than three times the magnificationpossible with optical microscopes. That made possible huge advances in many fields ofscience, including chemistry, biology and metallurgy.
Hillier took the design to  one of the companies in the U.S. after he graduated, starting a
long career with the company. While  there, he oversaw the development of thetechnology that  the company used in its videodisc system. He received 41 patents.
169
Hillier was born in Brantford, Ontario, and gave $500,000 US - more than half the
endowment -to the James Hillier Foundation, which provides 10 science scholarships tostudents from the area.
Hillier died in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had lived for many years. He was awarded
the Order of Canada in 1997. The citation describes the electron microscope as ""one ofthe scientific wonders of the modern world.""

The Daffodils

When all at once I saw a crowwd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the brreeze.Rhymes

CContinuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending linee
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
TThe waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be ggay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
What wealth the show to me had  brought:
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eeye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffoddils.

HOW F AMILIAR ARE YOU WITH THE FEA TURES OF FIGURA TIVE LANGUAGE?
1.Figurative language is a form of language use in which writers and speakers 
convey something other than the literal meaning of their words.
Here are some examples:
a) Metaphor
A comparison between essentially unlike things without an explicitly comparative word such
aslike or as. An example is "" My love is a red, red rose ,"" from Burns's ""A Red, Red Rose."" 
This is what Aristotle says in his Rhetoric . 
“It is metaphor above all else that gives cleanness, charm and
distinction to the style ”.
Rephrase it in your own words.
b) Simile
A figure of speech involving a comparison between unlike things using like, as, or as
though . An example: ""My love is like a red, red rose.""
c) Hyperbole or exaggeration.
d) Personification: endowing inanimate objects with human characteristics.
2. Re-read the poem and 
a)find a simile in stanza 1. What characterizes the 'lonely' cloud? what does the 
comparison between the poet and the cloud suggest? Justify your answer.
b)pick out another simile in stanza 2. 
c)Wordsworth uses personification in this poem. Pick out the details showing the
use of this figure of speech.
d)check if the poem contains a metaphor.
e)go back to 2 a and b above and try to convert each simile into a metaphor.
E.Read the poem aloud in an expressive way .

A. Read this extract from “As You Like it”, one of the Bard's plays.
Is the world a

The child forced

Excellent fighter
looking for fame
Getting weaker /
less good eyesight
Forgetful /
childish old man“This wide and universal theatre”
All the world is a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and entrances.
And one man in his time play many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
Then the whining school-boy, creeping like snail
Unwilling to school. And then the lover ,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut ,
Full of wise saws and modern instances
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slopper's pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.Are people simple
actors and mereplayers?

infomation.
Most smokers will come to a point in life where they want to quit.
Unfortunately, the addictive nature of tobacco and nicotine can make thisa very difficult thing to do for some people, but not impossible.   
Why Quit?
- Quitting smoking makes a difference. 
Right away -you can taste and smell food better. Your breath smells better. Your cough goes away. - Quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other respiratory illnesses. - Quitting smoking saves money.
To stop smoking is really a tough job to be done. Most smokers want toquit smoking, but find it difficult. You must have the desire to give up yourhabit and the confidence to know that you can do it. * Don't worry if you are sleepier  than usual; this feeling will pass. * Consider the positive things about quitting, such as health benefits foryou and your family, and the example you set for others around you. * When you feel tense, try to keep busy, think about ways to solve theproblem, tell yourself that smoking won't make it any better, and go dosomething else. * Eat regular meals. Feeling hungry is sometimes mistaken for the desireto smoke. * Start a money jar with the money you save by not buying cigarettes. * Constantly remind yourself of the negative effects of smoking and keepthem in mind, choose NOT TO ignore the problem.Benefits of quitting smoking How  to quit smoking

Lesson3IF … 
by Rudyard Kipling
READING INTO WRITING
Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was born in Bombay, but educated in England.
In 1882 he returned to India, where he worked for Anglo-Indian newspapers.He was chiefly known as a writer of short stories. A prolific writer, he achievedfame quickly.  In 1894 appeared his Jungle Book , which became a children's
classic all over the world. Other works include The Second Jungle Book
(1895), The Seven Seas (1896), Captains Courageous (1897), The Day's
Work (1898), Just So Stories (1902), Trafficks and Discoveries (1904)... His
collected poems appeared in 1933. He was awarded the Nobel Prize inLiterature in 1907.
 
Read this extract from the poem IFand answer the questions. 
2. What message does the poet want to convey .
IF
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;
If you can dream---and not make dreams your master;
If you can think---and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same.  […]
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings---nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute 
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!Rhymes

consumeconsumerism
Par.1: …………………………………………
Consumerism undoubtedly brings great physical comfort, convenience andvariety to those who can afford it. And whilst our advertising-soaked culturemakes it difficult for anyone to reject consumerism, it is foolish to claim that it hasbeen forced on people. If anything, people seem to love consumerism. They
actively choose to embrace it. 
205
206Par.2: …………………………………………
Consumerism doesn't inevitably bring happiness, fulfillment, or quality of life (asopposed to a high standard of living). People express nagging doubts about it,hinting that life in a consumer society is somehow alienating, unsatisfying andshallow. It isn't just empty nostalgia that makes us envy some of the qualities wesee in our less commercialized past, or in other less commercialized cultures.We see more integrated communities, a greater sense of belonging throughwork and neighbourhood. It's a powerful image, that of children once being ableto play in the street. And we suspect that pursuing consumerism has taken thesethings away from us - that we have collectively traded them
in for material
advantage.
Par.3: …………………………………………
Consumerism thrives in a self-centred society, in which real freedom and realleisure are replaced by conformity and ""choice"". It also tries to persuade us thatthis is the only form that progress can take, and that to reject consumerism it isto reject every aspect of modern technological culture. So in order to afford allthe useless stuff, we end up working harder in jobs we don't like, making orselling things no one really needs. But we don't have to go down this line. It's notthe only way to create jobs, nor is it the only way to meet our commercial andphysical needs. 
Par.4: …………………………………………
The standard response to anticonsumerism is to see it as having less, to see itas a sacrifice, automatically meaning a drop in our quality of life. But 'lowering'our material standard of living, moving away from a culture dominated by alwayswanting more, does not inevitably mean lowering our quality of life: it may evenimprove it. Quality of life is not an inevitable result of a high income, and a lowerincome does not invariably result in a feeling of 'having less'. These things arerelative, once our basic needs have been met. It is important to distinguishbetween the feeling that a comparative lack of wealth brings, and the actual levelof income we have. And in turn to carefully distinguish between consumeristtrappings, and those products and innovations that really do improve life, orhealth, or communication. These things can still be available in a culture that hasturned its back on the excesses of consumerism. It's a simplistic myth to say youcannot have one without the other.

Note : a gallon is
approximately 3.8 litres.
Road transport, including cars, is responsible for a quarter of all the UK's carbondioxide (CO
2) emissions. 
Transport also pollutes the air in towns and cities and although air quality in the UK
is slowly improving, many areas still don't meet national and European air qualitystandards. And consider this: every year, around 32,000 people in the UK die prematurely asa result of poor air quality.You can help reduce CO
2emissions and air pollution by reducing the amount of fuel
you use. That means walking, cycling or taking the bus for short journeys. When you
do have to use a car, follow some of these simple ecodriving tips and you couldsave around £120 and 280 kg of CO
2every year by driving more efficiently:
215/UIrecordavoid high speeds - Driving at 85 mph instead of 70 mph uses around 25 per cent 
more fuel 
/UIrecorddrive smoothly and consistently using higher gears when you can 
/UIrecorduse your air conditioning sparingly 
/UIrecordswitch off your engine when you're going to be stationary for more than a minute

1.Fahrenheit is a temperature scale named after the Polish-German
physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686 - 1736), who proposed it in 1724.On this scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit (written“32° F”), and the boiling point is 212 degrees, placing the boiling and freezingpoints of water exactly 180 degrees apart.On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are exactly 100degrees apart, thus the unit of this scale, a degree Fahrenheit, is 5/9  of adegree Celsius. Negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 °F) is equal to negative40 degrees Celsius  (-40 °C)

Some companies seem to be keener on going green than they are on their
employees. A survey by management consultancy Hudson found that three-quarters of executives would not hesitate to fire employees to boost productivityand performance. One in six think they could get rid of 20 per cent of employeeswithout damaging performance or morale; nearly half reckon firing up to 5 percent a year would be a good thing. Even though only 4 per cent actually carry out this threat, it is still a revealing finding. This is what executives reallythink of their 'most valued asset'. Not only that, they utterly ignore their
own
contribution to their employees' underperformance, raising so many questionsit is hard to know where to begin. 
228Only 38 per cent of employees feel managers and directors treat them with
respect, and 66 per cent don't trust them. Around a quarter of employees rarelyor never look forward to going to work, and almost half are leaving or trying to.Researches suggest many managers aren't doing enough to keep their staffinterested. The result: underperformance and low productivity. 
A UK survey showed that in 2005 just 16 per cent of UK employees were
'positively engaged' - loyal and committed to the organisation. The rest werephysically present but psychologically absent. They express theirdisappointment by going sick, not trying, leaving or threatening to strike […]The culprit, says the survey, is poor management. 'Workers say they don't knowwhat is expected of them, managers don't care about them as people, their
jobs aren't a good fit for their talents and their views count for little'.

Over the years Lottie had urged Bess to prepare for her old age. Over the years
Bess had lived each day as if there were no other. Now they were both pastsixty, the time for summing up. Lottie had a bank account that had never grownlean.  Bess had the clothes on her back, and the rest of her worldly possessionsin a small suitcase.Lottie had hated being a child, seeing her parents struggling to make endsmeet. Bess had never seemed to notice. All she ever wanted was to go outsideand play. Lottie couldn't wait to grow up and buy herself the best of everything. 
237[…] As soon as anyone would hire her, Lottie put herself to work. By the time
she was twelve, she was working after school in a small variety store. Shebegan to bank her money, and her bankbook became her most preciouspossession. In her last year high she was faced with the choice of staying inschool or working full time. She made her choice easily. A job in hand was
worth two in the future.Bess met Harry at school. He had no other ambition except to play music. ThatBess married Harry straight out of school was not surprising. That Lottie nevermarried at all was not really surprising either.Bess's married life was nothing to envy. She and Harry lived like gypsies. Harryplaying in second-rate bands all over the country, even getting himself and Bessstuck in Europe. They were often in rags and never in riches . Bess grieved
because she had no child, not having sense enough to know she was better offwithout one. Lottie was certainly better off without nieces and nephews to feelsorry for. Very likely Bess would have left them on her doorstep.That Lottie had a doorstep was only because her boss, having bought a secondhouse, offered Lottie his first house at a price so low and terms so reasonablethat it would have been like losing money to refuse. She shut off the rooms shedidn't use. Her way of life was mean and miserly, but she did not know it. Shethought she lived frugally in her middle years so that she could live in comfortand ease when she most needed peace of mind. The years, after forty, beganto race. Suddenly Lottie was sixty, and retired from her job.Harry died abroad, in a third-rate hotel, leaving Bess nothing. There wasn't evenmoney for her travel home. Lottie, trapped by the blood tie, knew she wouldhave not only to send for her sister, but take her in when she returned. It didn'tseem fair that Bess should reap the harvest of Lottie's lifetime of self-denial.
[…] She was in the kitchen when Bess rang the bell. She went to the door, andBess stood before her. « Oh, Lottie, it's good to see you, » Bess said, but sayingnothing about Lottie's splendid appearance. Upstairs Bess, putting her shabbysuitcase, said « I'll sleep like a rock tonight, » without a word of praise for herlovely room.
With the glow of good food in her stomach, Bess began to spin stories. They
were rich with places and people, most of them very ordinary, all of themmagnificent. Her face reflected her telling, the joys and sorrows of herremembering, and above all, the love she lived by that enhanced the poorestplace, the humblest person.She said, « That's enough about me. How have the years used you? »
« It was me who didn't use them, » said Lottie. « I saved for them. I forgot thebest of them would go without my ever spending a day or a dollar enjoyingthem. That's my life story in those few words, a life never lived. Now it's too nearthe end to try. »Bess said: « Don't count the years that are left us. You've too much catching upto waste a minute feeling sorry for yourself. »Lottie grinned, a real wide open grin, « Well to tell the truth I felt sorry for you.May be if I had any sense I'd feel sorry for myself, after all. I know I'm too old;but I'm going to let you show me how to live. »

2.Find out why Jacques was anxious. 
3.Identify the tone in Jacques' speech.
4.Rephrase the following statement differently starting as shown.
Never once has there been a complaint.
There ..........................................................................................................
241Section 1
One morning the president of the Provincial Milk Company came to inspect theearly morning deliveries. Jacques pointed Pierre out to him and said: “Watchhow he talks to that horse. See how the horse listens and how he turns his headtoward Pierre? See the look in that horse's eyes? You know, I think those twoshare a secret. I have often noticed it. It is as though they both sometimeschuckle at us as they go off on their route. Pierre is a good man, MonsieurPresident, but he gets old. Would it be too bold of me to suggest that he beretired and be given perhaps a small pension?” he added anxiously.
Section 2“But of course”, the president laughed. “I know his record. He has been on thisroute now for thirty years and never once has there been a complaint. Tell himit is time he rested. His salary will go on just the same”. But Pierre refused to retire. He was panic-stricken at the thought of not drivingJoseph every day. “We are two old men”, he said to Jacques. “Let us wear outtogether. When Joseph is ready to retire - then I, too, will quit”. Jacques, whowas a kind man, understood. There was something about Pierre and Josephwhich made a man smile tenderly. It was as though each drew some hiddenstrength from the other. When Pierre was sitting in his seat, and when Josephwas hitched to the wagon, neither seemed old. But when they finished theirwork, then Pierre would limp down the street slowly, seeming very old indeed,and the horse's head would drop and he would walk very wearily to his stall.Then one morning Jacques had dreadful news for Pierre when he arrived. Itwas a cold morning and still pitch-dark. The air was like iced wine that morningand the snow which had fallen during the night glistened like a million diamondspiled together.5. Do you expect Pierre to quit his job? Why? Why not?
Now read section 2 .
1.Have you guessed right? Correct  your guesses if necessary.
2.Pick out an expression showing Pierre was deeply shocked. 
3.Find details proving Pierre and Joseph have grown old.
4.Identify two similes.
6. Guess what the sad piece of news might be.
Read the next section and answer the questions in the margin.
Section 3
Jacques said, “Pierre, your horse, Joseph, did not wake up this morning. He wasvery old, Pierre, he was twenty-five and that is like being seventy-five for a man”.“Yes”, Pierre said slowly. “Yes. I am seventy-five. And I cannot see Joseph again”.
242Did Pierre walk into the truck deliberately or accidentally? 
Read the last section to find out.
1.Have you guessed right?
2.What do you think of the way Jacques announced the sad news to Pierre?
3.Why do you think Pierre's eyes looked lifeless?
4.Paraphrase the following statement.
The eyes were mirroring the grief that was in Pierre's heart and his soul. 
5.What does 'neither' (inbold typein the text) refer to?
6.Guess what might have happened to Pierre.“Of course you can”, Jacques soothed. “He is over in his stall, looking very
peaceful. Go over and see him.”Pierre took one step forward, then turned. “No … no … you don't understand,Jacques”. Jacques clapped him on the shoulder. “We'll find another horse just as good asJoseph. Why, in a month you'll teach him to know your route as well as Josephdid. We will.The look in Pierre's eyes stopped him. For years Pierre had worn a heavy cap,the peak of which came low over his eyes, keeping the bitter morning wind outof them. Now Jacques looked into Pierre's eyes and he saw something whichstartled him. He saw a dead, lifeless look in them. The eyes were mirroring thegrief that was in Pierre's hearts and his soul. It was as though his heart and soulhad died.“Take today off, Pierre,” Jacques said, but already Pierre was hobbling off downthe street, and had one been near one would have seen tears streaming downhis cheeks and have heard half-smothered sobs. Pierre walked to the cornerand stepped into the street. There was a warning yell from the driver of a hugetruck that was coming fast and there was the scream of brakes, but Pierreapparently heard neither .
Section 4
Five minutes later an ambulance driver said, “He's dead. Was killed instantly”. Jacques and several of the milk-wagon drivers had arrived and they lookeddown at the still figure.“I couldn't help it,” the driver of the truck protested, “he walked right into mytruck. He never saw it, I guess. Why, he walked into it as though he were blind”. The ambulance doctor bent down. “Blind? Of course the man was blind. Seethose cataracts? This man has been blind for five years.” He turned to Jacques,“You say he worked for you? Didn't you know he was blind?” “No …. no …” Jacques said, softly. “None of us knew. Only one knew - a friendof his named Joseph … It was a secret, I think, just between those two”. 
2431. Tick the right options. 
a-The cause (s) of this tragic end is / are 
- despair - destiny - Jacques' irresponsible attitude - blindness - old age 
b-After Joseph's death, Pierre felt he lost his

CHECK YOUR LANGUAGE
1. Supply the correct form of the bracketed words.
The standard response to anticonsumerism is to make it seem as having
less, to see it as a sacrifice, automatically meaning a drop in our quality oflife. But 'lowering' our material standard of ( live) , moving away from a
culture dominated by always ( want ) more, does not ( inevitable )  mean
lowering our quality of life: it may even improve it. Quality of life is not aninevitable result of a ( height) income, and a lower income does not
invariably result in a feeling of 'having less'. These things are ( relative ), once
our ( basis )  needs have been met. If as one lone individual we try and
consume a fairer share of the world's resources, and no one else does, weare (bind) to feel ill-at-ease.
2. Read the paragraph below and cross out 2 irrelevant sentences.
Up until the late 19th century, a sprained ankle or a broken arm could only
be diagnosed by means of physical examination. It all happened quite byaccident, when Alexander Fleming discovered that mould had killed bacteriain a lab dish he had forgotten to clean. It was W. Röntgen who first demonstrated the power of X rays in 1895. Thisimportant innovation made its ways into routine care a few years later andmade the diagnosing of international problems easier, safer and less painfulfor patients.When he presented his findings, nobody took notice of the potential benefits.All those scientists, who put their hearts and souls into research, tookimaging technology one step further with the development of ultrasound andCAT scan, which now help to diagnose disease early. The truth is that ifantibiotics did not exist today even a common cold could kill us .

In an unprecedented study based on information contained in the 2000population census, conducted by the Brazilian institute of geography andstatistics it is shown that migration is closely related to low levels of schoolingand that the majority of people who migrate are successful and end upreturning home and many simply prefer to remain in their regions of origin among the total of 5.1 million people who migrated between 1995 and 200066% didn't complete fundamental education Fernando albuquerque who is aspecialist in the institute affirms in the current situation with qualificationrequirements and unemployment they are unable to find jobs.

263THE + ADJECTIVE

The adjective can be modified by an adverb:
The very rich                     /           The severely disabled
Some adjectives normally take an adverb/

quality.He reads a lot of books on the supernatural.

USED TO + VERB / BE USED TO + VERB + ING
USED TO DO
We use 'used to' for something that happened regularly in the past but no
longer happens.
I used to smoke a packet a day but I stopped two years ago. 
Ben used to travel a lot in his job but now, since his promotion, he doesn't. 
I used to drive to work but now I take the bus. 
We also use it for something that was true but  no longer is.
There used to be a cinema in the town but now there isn't. 
She used to have really long hair but she's had it all cut off. 
I didn't use to like him but now I do. 
'Used to do' is different from 'to be used to doing' and 'to get used to doing'
TO BE USED TO DOING SOMETHING
We use 'to be used to doing' to say that something is normal, not unusual.
I'm used to living on my own. I've done it for quite a long time. 
Hans has lived in England for over a year so he is used to driving on the left now. 
They've always lived in hot countries so they aren't used to the cold weather here.
264TO BE / GET USED TO DOING SOMETHING
We use 'to get used to doing' to talk about the process of something becoming normalfor us.I didn't understand the accent when I first moved here but I quickly got used to it. She has started working nights and is still getting used to sleeping during the day. I have always lived in the country but now I'm beginning to get used to living in the city.
THE SUBJUNCTIVE
FORMUse the simple form of the verb : the infinitive without ""to"" with all the subjects(singular or plural) USE The Subjunctive is used to emphasize urgency or importance. It is used aftercertain expressions and in formal, impersonal English.
In more informal language we commonly use should.
This form is used more frequently in British English and is most common after theverbs ""suggest,"" ""recommend"" and ""insist.""Examples :The police insisted the car should be moved / be moved immediatelyI suggest
that he  study . 
Is it essential that we bethere? 
We recommended that she jointhe committee. 
Verbs followed by the Subjunctive
to command to demand to insist to propose to recommend to suggest 
EXAMPLES: Dr. Dave demanded that John prepare his research paper before the end of the month.
Brian proposed 
that Frank  beat the party. 
The teacher  insists that the students arrive on time. 
Expressions followed by the Subjunctive
It is best (that) It is crucial (that) It is desirable (that) It is essential (that) It is imperative (that) It is important (that) It is recommended (that) It is urgent (that) It is vital (that) It is a good idea (that) It is a bad idea (that)
265EXAMPLES : 
It is crucial that you  beon time for a job interview. 
It is urgent that she  take her son to the doctor. 
It is imperative that he attend all the lectures.
RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE / NON-RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE
WHAT IS A RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE?
Arestrictive clause provides essential information about the subject of a
sentence : it restricts the meaning of a sentence by identifying the specific qualities
of the noun or pronoun. Example: The book which is on the desk is mine.
Here the restrictive clause ""which is on the desk "" tells which book is mine. There
might be other books in other places, but this sentence is only concerned with thebook that is on the bureau. Do not use commas with a restrictive clause.Correct:    The book which is on the desk is mine.Incorrect:  The book, which is on the desk , is mine.
In this example, the restrictive clause identifies the subject of the sentence: 
The girl who is picking flowers is beautiful.
The adjective clause tells which girl is in love; there could be a dozen other girls in
the area, but only one is picking flowers. 
Restrictive clauses do not need commas.
WHAT IS A NON-RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE?Non-restrictive clauses provide descriptive information that isn't essential to the
meaning of the sentence. Examples:The detective, who was short and fat, took down my statement.
The car, which was brand-new, was parked in the garage.
In these examples, the non-restrictive clauses, which are highlighted, provide extra
information about the main subject of the sentence. Non-restrictive clauses are enclosed with commas
266INVERSION
Inversion refers to an irregular verb placement form. 
Generally, an inversion is used to stress the uniqueness of an event and beginswith a negative. Use of Question Form Inversion refers to the use of question form ( auxiliary + subject + main verb ) instead
of the standard positive sentence structure (i.e. He goes to work every day) :Examples Not only do I enjoy classical music, but I also have a season ticket to the symphony.
Seldom has the boss been so upset! 
In this case, the question form is substituted for standard sentence structure in astatement. Negative 
Adverbials 
Time expressions: never, rarely, seldom These time expressions are used with a perfect form  and often include comparatives: ExamplesNever has she been moresuccessful !
Seldom has he seen anything stranger. 
T
ime expressions: hardly , barely , no sooner , or scarcely 
These time expressions are used when there are a succession of events in the past. Examples Scarcely had I got out of bed when the doorbell rang.
No sooner had he finished dinner, when she walked in the door. 
After 'Only' Expressions such as 'only after', 'only when', 'only then', etc. 'Only' is used with a time expression. Examples Only then did I understand the problem. 
Only after understanding the situation does the teacher make a comment. 
After 'Little' 
'Little' is used in a negative sense. ExamplesLittle did he understand the situation.
Little have I read concerning nanotechnology. 
Inverted Conditional Forms 
Sometimes conditional forms are inverted as a means of sounding more formal.In this case, the conditional 'if' is dropped and the inverted forms take the placeof the 'if clause' . 
Examples Had he understood the problem, he wouldn't have committed those mistakes. (If he
had understood the problem, he wouldn't have committed those mistakes.)Should he decide to come, please telephone. (If he decides to come, please
telephone.)
267NEED / NEEDN'T/ NEEDN'T HAVE
We use needn't and don't have to  say that something is unnecessary
Youneedn't come early.
You do not have to make an appointment.
Need as an ordinary verb: used to express necessity, obligation. 
Wedon't need to leave now.
I need to get some sleep.
Do you need to show your identity card?
Needn't have done / didn't need to: used to talk about an unnecessary pastaction. The action happened but we know that it was unnecessary.You needn't have cooked / you didn't need to cook
so much food. (You cooked
much food but it wasn't necessary).Didn't need to: means that the action didn't happen.Wedidn't need to make any sandwiches. We knew that people were bringing their
own. (We didn't make them because it wasn't necessary.)
COULD HAVE
We can use 'could have' to talk about something somebody was capable ofdoing but didn't do.
I could have gone to Oxford University but I preferred Harvard. She could have married him but she didn't want to. They could have bought a house here 20 years ago but chose not to.
Often, there is a sense of criticism.
You could have phoned me to let me know. They could have helped me instead of just sitting there. I could have done more to help you. Sorry.
We can use 'couldn't have' to talk about something we were not capable of doing.
I couldn't have managed without you. I couldn't have got the job. He was always going to appoint his nephew. I couldn't have enjoyed myself more. Thank you for a lovely day. 
We can use 'could have' to speculate about what has happened. (We can alsouse 'may have' or 'might have' in these situations.)
She could have taken the earlier train. Simon could have told her. They could have overheard what we said. 
We can also use 'could have' to speculate about something that didn't happen.
You could have broken your neck, jumping out the window like that. He could have hurt somebody, throwing a bottle out of the window like that. I could have done well in my exam if I'd worked harder . Need + to + verb                                    = obligation / necessity
Needn't + verb                                       = absence of necessity in the present
Needn't + have + past participle    =   absence of necessity in the past. You did 
something but it wasn't necessary
268You can also use 'could have' to talk about possible present situations that
have not happened. 
He could have been Manager now but he got involved in a big financial problem. They could have been the market leaders now if they had taken his advice. I could have been earning a lot as an accountant but the work was just too boring
CLAUSES OF CONTRAST
Clauses of Contrast give information that contrasts with or opposes the facts in themain clause in an unexpected way. These clauses can be introduced withconjunctions such as although, (even) though, however, etc . some of these words
and phrases introduce the known or background information; others introduce theunexpected contrast.
Even though it was much too hot, I went out.
Everyone played well. However, we still lost the game;
While can replace although: 
While I see your point, I still think you're wrong. 
The prepositions in spite of and despite are followed by a noun phrase 
or -ing
form :
In spite of the price, I've decided to buy the car.
Despite feeling dreadful, Max went swimming.
WHO , WHOM , OF WHICH
Who and whom as relative pronouns.
A relative pronoun must refer to a noun preceding it.The man whom
she most admires will be here tonight. 
In this example whom is a relative pronoun to MAN. 
The candidate will choose who will act as campaign director. 
In this example  who is a personal pronoun.
Correct usage of the who/whom pronouns presents difficulties. The followingguidelines and examples may help you determine which one to use.If a pronoun (he, she, it, they) could serve as the subject of the who/whom clause,
use who . 
In the example above, who is part of a clause that modifies the subject of the
sentence, John Smith. If who were replaced with he or John Smith, the clausewould make sense and reinforce the idea that who not only refers to the subject ofthe sentence but could also replace it. 
When a pronoun functions as the object of a clause, use whom .John Smith, who was respected by all the pupils, was the best teacher in
the school.
John Smith, whom all the pupils respected, was the best teacher in the
school.
269In the example above, the whom clause modifies the subject of the sentence. It
differs from the first example, however, in that whom functions as the object of the
clause in which it exists. 'All the pupils' is the subject in the clause, while whom
(referring to John Smith) is the object the verb respected refers to . 
When a preposition (in, of, on, without, at, from) precedes the pronoun, use
whom or which.
PARALLELISM
When two elements of a sentence are similar in meaning, you should expressthem in parallel form. In other words, all linked words should match in form. 
By using parallel structure, we both clarify the meaning of our writing  and add
symmetry to it. Parallel structure joins and emphasizes equally important ideas. 1. Co-ordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, for, so, yet). 
She likes dancing and swimmingHe wanted to buy a new car or a small apartment.
2. Correlative Conjunctions (either …or, neither…nor, both…and, not only …but
also, whether…or)
We can either watch a film or listen to music.Neither my mother nor my father speaks English fluently.My brother is not only intelligent but also hard-working.You will need both English and German for this job.
3. Words in a series
She reads novels, short stories and plays.They bought a laptop, a webcam, a flash disk and a mouse.
4. Comparisons and contrasts using than or as (i.e., more than, as much as) 
I don't like French as much as I like English.We practise basketball more than we practise volleyball.
5. Function words: 
A function word that begins one clause must begin the others.
prepositions (to, by, in, for) : They take part in debates and in forums.
articles (a, an, the) : The documentary was about the Native Americans and the
Aborigines.the infinitive (to) : She decided to be serious, to work hard and to attend all the
lectures.introductory words (that, who, which, because, when) : I believe that she is
innocent and that she deserves our apologies.- The anonymous donor, of whom we speak , gave ten million dollars to 
help the refugees.
- The lady to whom I made the promise to work hard is my English teacher.
- The book, from which I took the information , is a thesaurus. 
- The secondary school, to which they go , was built in 1965.

271COLLOCATIONS, METAPHORS AND IDIOMS
COLLOCATIONS
1. What is collocation ? Collocation is the way in which particular words tend to occur or belongtogether.
We say that words that occur together frequently « collocate ».Words that do notcollocate almost never occur together. If we try, they sound unnatural and wrong :
Time speeds / travels / rides / moves (  = they don't collocate).
Time flies / goes by / wears on / passes (= they collocate). 
There are no rules or logical explanations for why some words collocate and othersdon't. For example, we can talk about an academic year but not a studying year.Discussions can be productive or fruitful  but not prolific. 
METAPHORS
A metaphor is a combination of vocabulary items used in an imaginative way to
describe something or someone , in order to show that the 2 things have the samequalities and to make the description more powerful.For example, her sunny smile, have a big head, purr with delight, a sundrenched beach, pull strings.
1- Words used metaphorically:Here are some examples of words being used metaphorically:I hope this will have cushioned your loss. Seeing him on stage fired my enthusiasm. She just froze when she saw her ex-boyfriend. He's always trumpeting his own successes.2- Compound adjectives and nouns as metaphors:Some compounds are always metaphorical - they have a meaning that each partof the compound doesn't have a bloodbath is never 'a bath full of blood'; thecompound has only the meaning of 'a massacre'. Other examples of compoundsthat are always metaphorical include:mind games       mind-reader    narrow-minded     warm-hearted      bone-dryhard-bitten
IDIOMS
An idiom is a group of words whose meaning is different from the meanings of the
individual words.Examples : The life and soul of the party: the most amusing or interesting person at a party.
Make it to the top: be successful.
Meeting of minds: a close understanding between people with similar ideas.
All of a sudden: quickly and unexpectedly.

It addresses all students in various streams through a common core of lessons, withadditional material for the Arts students to be covered in the two weekly extrahours. These are labelled : For Arts Students. The book is made up of an Introductory Unit, 4 nine-lesson Units and 3 Consolidation Units (Checking Year 3,Check your Language and Skills 1&2)with a last section entitled ADD-ONS including a Grammar Reference, V ocabulary strategies, Irregular Verbs and a Word List . The units are based on all four language skills which are developed in an integrated manner .This skills blend is reflected in the use of INTO in the lesson titles which are labelled :Speaking INTO Reading , Listening INTO Writing,Reading INTO Writing, Speaking INTO Listening. This skill integration takes students from the construction of meaning through listening and reading passages to communicating in speech and writing. The listening and reading texts are exploited for information and linguistic content and serve as a springboard for production. They come from differentsources: novels, magazines, newspapers, ads, leaflets, poems, songs, plays… tosensitize students to different genres. The learner is led to construct knowledge and learn how to reinvest it in a range of situations that relate to real life. Activities range from group work and pair work to webquests and projects .The integration of Information Communication Technology and the development of personal projects foster students' autonomy and creativity beyondthe classroom . Students are also engaged in using various sources of information such as dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms, thesauruses and the Internet. Language is not only a means of communication to interact with others inside and outside the classroom but it is also handled as a system . Language components are presented in meaningful contexts and recycled at various levelsof complexity. Grammar is dealt with inductively to get the students to reflect on language and how it works. Pronunciation is also given due importance througha variety of activities that allow further practice of sounds, word stress andintonation. Practice of linguistic items is catered for in the Grammar Focus ,Lexical Focus and Pronunciation Focus sections included within the lessons. Three permanent components are to be found at the end of each lesson : My New Words, My Grammar andWHAT I CAN DO NOW. 4After completing two units, students are provided with a set of activities labelled as 'Check your Language and Skills' for further practice of the language acquired and a better skills development. Portfolios are used by students to keep track of their progress through creating vocabulary files, various pieces of writing , summaries of texts orstories , poems and a selection of information they get through Webquests . We hope the implementation of the official syllabus has been carried out successfully and that students will engage in enjoyable learning and acquire abetter mastery of the language which will enable them to pursue learning for lifeusing skills and strategies that shape the profile of the autonomous learner.

While all of these countriesshare the same mother tongue, there are some differences inthe way they speak and write. The first difference is in the accent. Each country has its ownaccent. And within each country there are a variety of accentscalled regional accents. Another difference is the spelling of some words, like color andcolour, or theater and theatre. And a third difference is that some of the words are not the same at all. For example, Americans say restroom, Canadians say washroom, and the British say W.C. (water closet.)

The competition for space tourists is playing out in China as well as the United States, with rival companies signing up well-to-do customers for future flights.The face-off has as much to do with winning a foothold in the world's biggestpotential market as well as achieving another first in the annals of spaceflight. More than a year ago, Virginia-based Space Adventures announced that Hong Kong-based businessman Jiang Feng was paying $100,000 to take a suborbitalpassenger flight aboard an unspecified spaceship that has yet to be built. Nowan adviser to British-based Virgin Galactic says a businessman from eastern China's Zhejiang province will be among the first 100 passengers for Virgin'sSpaceship Two suborbital rocket plane. Like Space Adventures, Virgin Galactic is one of the leaders in the emerging space tourism industry. The Shanghai adviser, Rupert Hoogewerf, told Reutersthat the businessman has paid Virgin's $200,000 fare for the flight package.Hoogewerf said the man was under 40 and had asked for his identity to be keptsecret. Jiang as well as Virgin's mystery client are competing for the title of ""first Chinese space tourist"" — but it's not yet clear which one will fly first. VirginGalactic, owned by British billionaire Richard Branson, has said it will begintaking on passengers in the 2008-2009 time frame. Its rocket plane is designedto carry six passengers and two pilots on 2.5-hour flights to the edge of space.Virgin's first spaceflights would take off from Mojave, California, with a move toNew Mexico's future spaceport planned for 2009-2010. 43Space Adventures, meanwhile, has forged agreements with a variety of spaceship developers — including a deal with the Russian Federal SpaceAgency and the Prodea Venture capital firm reportedly aimed at beginningsuborbital tourism service in the next couple of years. However, SpaceAdventures' time frame has shifted over the past couple of years. Last year,the company projected that Jiang would be able to fly in 2007. Since 2001, Space Adventures has arranged for four private-sector space passengers to take orbital trips to the international space station, at anestimated cost of $20 million each.

Leonteswas so happy in the love of this excellent lady that he had nothingleft to wish for, except that he sometimes wanted to see again, andto present to his queen, his old companion and school-fellow,Polixenes, king of Bohemia. Leontes and Polixenes had been brought up together from the time when they were children, but, after the death of their fathers, eachone had to rule his own kingdom, and so they had not met for manyyears, though they often exchanged gifts, letters and lovingmessages. At last, after many invitations, Polixenes came from Bohemia to the Sicilian court, to make a visit to his friend Leontes. At first, this visit gave nothing but pleasure to Leontes. He begged the queen to give this friend of his youth her special care and attention and seemed to have his happiness quitecompleted when he was with his old companion. They talked about old times; theyremembered their schooldays and their youthful games. They told stories of these toHermione, who always took a cheerful part in these conversations. After a long stay, Polixenes was preparing to leave when Hermione, at her husband's wish, begged him to make his visit longer. And now, this good queen's sorrow began. Polixenes had refused to stay when Leontes asked him but Hermione's gentle words persuaded him to do so. At this,although Leontes had so long known the honesty of his friend Polixenes as well as theexcellent character of his good queen, he was seized with an uncontrollable jealousy.Everything that Hermione did for Polixenes, although it was done only to please herhusband, increased the unfortunate king's jealousy. Suddenly, Leontes changed from atrue friend, and the best and most loving of husbands, into a wild and evil creature. Hesent for Camillo, one of the lords of his court, and told him of his suspicions about hiswife's unfaithfulness. Then he ordered him to poison Polixenes. Camillo was a good man. He knew well that there was no truth in what Leontes suspected, and so, instead of poisoning Polixenes, he told him of his master's orders andagreed to escape with him from Sicily. Thus Polixenes, with the help of Camillo, arrivedsafely in his own kingdom of Bohemia. From that time, Camillo lived in the king's courtand became the chief friend and favourite of Polixenes. The escape of Polixenes made the jealous Leontes still more angry. He went to the queen's room where her little son Mamillius was just beginning to tell one of his beststories to amuse her. Taking the child away, the king sent Hermione to prison. 80Though Mamillius was only a very young child he loved his mother dearly. When he sawher treated so shamefully and knew that she hadbeen taken away from him to be put into prison,he became very unhappy. Gradually, he lost hisdesire to eat and sleep until it was thought thathis sadness would kill him. When the king had sent his queen to prison, he commanded Cleomenes and Dion, twoSicilian lords, to go to Delphos and ask theoracle at the temple of Apollo if his queen hadbeen unfaithful to him. 11.

Hermione had a kind and noble-spirited friend, Paulina, who was the wife of Antigonus, a Sicilian lord. When Paulina heard that the queen had given birth to a child,she went to the prison where Hermione was kept and said to Emilia, a lady who servedHermione, “I pray you, Emilia, tell the good queen that if she will trust me with her littlebaby, I will carry it to the king, its father. We do not know how his heart may soften whenhe sees his little child.” “Most noble lady,” replied Emilia, “I will tell the queen of your offer. She was wishing today that she had a friend who would dare to present the child to the king.” “And tell her,” said Paulina, “that I will speak bravely to Leontes in her defence.” “May you be for ever blessed,” said Emilia, “for your kindness to our gentle queen!"" Emilia then went to Hermione who joyfully gave up her baby to the care of Paulina. Paulina took the child and forced herself into the presence of the king, although her husband, who fearedthe king's anger, tried to prevent her. She laid the baby at its father's feet, and made a noble speech to the king in defence of Hermione. She blamed him for his cruelty and begged him to have pity on his innocentwife and child. But her words only increased Leontes' anger, and he ordered her husbandAntigonus to take her away. When Paulina went away, she left the little baby at its father’s feet She thought that, when he was alone with it, he would look at it, and have pity on its innocence. The good Paulina was wrong. No sooner had she gone than the pitiless father ordered Antigonus to take the child out to sea and leave it on some empty shore to die. Antigonus was not like the good Camillo. He obeyed the orders of Leontes too well. He carried the child on to a ship at once and sailed out to sea, intending to leave it onthe first lonely shore that he could find.“THE WINTER’S TALE” PART 2For Arts Students 1: Session 1 83The king was so sure that Hermione was guilty that he would not wait for the return of Cleomenes and Dion from Delphos. Before the queen had recovered from herweakness, and from her misery at losing her precious baby, she was brought to a publictrial before all the lords and nobles of his court. When all the great lords and judges weregathered together to try Hermione, and while that unhappy lady was standing as aprisoner to receive their judgment, Cleomenes and Dion entered, and gave the king theanswer of the oracle. Leontes commanded that the words of the oracle should be read aloud, and these were the words: “Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true servant, Leontes a jealous and cruel king, and he shall live without an heir unless that which was lost is found.” The king would not believe the words of the oracle. He said that it was a lie made up by the queen's friends, and he asked the judge to go on with the trial of the queen. Whilehe was speaking, however, a man entered and told him that the prince, Mamillius,hearing that his mother was to be tried for her life, had been struck with grief andshame, and had suddenly died. When Hermione heard of the death of this dear and loving child who had lost his life because of his grief at her misfortune, she fainted. Leontes himself was filled with miseryby the news and began to feel pity for his unhappy queen. He ordered Paulina to takeher away and help her to recover. Paulina soon returned, and told the king that Hermionewas dead. When Leontes heard that the queen was dead, he felt deeply sorry for all his cruelty to her. Now that he thought his ill-treatment had broken Hermione's heart, he believed herto be innocent. Now also he thought the words of the oracle were true. He knew that “ifthat which was lost is not found” (which he believed to be his young daughter), he wouldbe without an heir, as the young prince Mamillius was dead; and he would have givenhis kingdom to recover his lost daughter.

Children spend most of the daywith a class teacher and they havespecialist teachers for subjects such asMusic and French. The subject areas ofGeography, History, Science, Art,Drama, Design and Technology aresometimes drawn together in themes ortopics.At secondary level children are taught by subject teachers. Up to the age of 14,secondary schools give a broad, balancededucation. From 14 to 16 pupils are taught ingroups that relate to the subjects and levelsfor their GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education). The first 3 years focus on studies that must include the three“core” subjects of mathematics, English andScience in addition to the 7 “foundation”subjects of technology, history, geography, aforeign language, art, music and physicaleducation. 104The National Curriculum is divided into four “Key Stages”, which broadly relate to pupils’ ages: KS1 from five to seven KS2 from seven to eleven, KS3 from eleven to fourteen, KS4from fourteen to sixteen.

School where pupils will be taught according to …………………… instead of age A SECONDARY school is to become the first state school in England to teach all its pupils according to their ability rather than their age. (A) Pupils at Bridgemary School in Gosport, Hampshire, will be taught in mixed-age classes from September under the radical initiative to boost standards.For each subject they will be assessed via testsand teacher judgments then allocated to one offive levels, depending on their ability. (B) 'Children get bored or their behaviour can get challenging if they are not being pushed because the levels within class are too different.' Mrs. Heron, 50, took over at Bridgemary three years ago. It has 1,100 pupils aged 11to 16 and is in a deprived urban area. Shortly after her arrival, Bridgemary was classed by schools watchdog Ofsted as having 'serious weaknesses' with most pupilsfailing to gain five good GCSEs. Mrs. Heron said the new 'personalised learning' system was aimed at tackling the culture of under-achievement. She added: “We have got to find a way to change thisculture and I am of the opinion that thenormal class system does not seem to beworking.”The five levels are access, entry, level one, level two and level three. Access deals with basic numeracy and literacy, while level three isequivalent to A-levels. The school tested the plan when it transformed traditional tutor groups into mixed age 'learning groups'. Mrs. Heron - described by Ofsted as an 'excellent leader who was driving the school forward' - said no problems had been found with having older and younger children together. The school's plan for a total switch to classes based on ability reflects the resurgence in support for differentiating by ability, which wasonce condemned as anti-comprehensive. (C) It is estimated that 60 per cent of secondary schools employ some form of streaming but experts say the level of personalised learning Bridgemary plans is unheard of. Dr. Faysal Mikdadi, chairman of governors at Bridgemary and an Ofsted inspector, said: “A lotof people will say we are moving away from the comprehensive ideal. I don't think that is true and anyway I could not care less about an ideal. 'I care about whether these children are achieving their potential.” The scheme is being monitored by the local authority and Ofsted.

Check your reading rate. You are going to read a 6-paragraph text about Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.Take 1 minute to read as much as you can of the text. Stop after one minute sharp . Count the words you managed to read. What is your reading speed ? Has it improved compared to your score when you read the biographical notes about Sting in the Introductory Unit ? Go round the class and find out about your classmates’ reading rate.What is the average number of words other students managed to read in one minute? 2. Once you have read the text,complete the title with ONEword (other than inventor). He was “troubled all his life by the timeless and universal human need to communicate,” says a biographer of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. And it wasnot alone through his invention but even more, perhaps, as a teacher of speech, thatAlexander Graham Bell pursued that goal. He would rather be remembered as a teacherof the deaf, he told his family, than as the inventor of the telephone. And what a teacher hewas! — enthusiastic, innovative, sympathetic, creative. Alexander Graham Bell’s family were no strangers to the communicative arts. His grandfather, for whom he was named, was a well-known elocutionist and actor inEdinburgh Scotland, where the younger Alexander was born on March 3, 1847. In additionto giving public lectures and dramatic readings, the elder Bell developed a considerablepractice in the treatment of speech defects, such as stammering, lisping, and otherimpediments. He wrote two books, Stammering and other Impediments of Speech and ThePractical Elocutionist, which used comma-like symbols to indicate word grouping andemphasis. In his middle teens, young Alec, as he was called, spent a year with his grandfather, who was at that time living in London. This experience had a lasting influence on his life, and itgave him a maturity and seriousness of purpose that made him seem in some waysconsiderably older than his years.1. 2. 1193. Bell’s father, Alexander Melville Bell, gained a worldwide reputation as a teacher of correct speech and lecturer on elocution. When only a young man he began investigatingthe working of the vocal organs. Melville Bell, like his father, studied the anatomy ofspeech and approached his subject with scientific thoroughness. In 1864, he completed a universally applicable phonetic alphabet by which he could describe the manner of production of the sounds of nearly all known languages. He called this alphabet “Visible Speech” and its various symbols (thirty-four in all) showed how the vocal organswould be positioned to make a sound. 4.Alec and his brothers became quite adept at using the “Visible Speech’ alphabet, reading the symbols and producing the sounds they represented. In demonstrations,linguists from various parts of the world dictated words to Melville Bell from a number ofdifferent “exotic” languages, dialects and accents (including American Indian languagesArabic, Hindi, Persian, Urdu, and many more), and his sons produced the sounds from thesymbols their father had written down . Their performance was impressive, and acommentary in the London Illustrated Times proclaimed: “We cannot pretend even toguess at the horizons opened up by such an alphabet in the training of the deaf, the dumb, and the blind.” 5.Alec’s mother was a musician as well as an accomplished portrait painter, and her son was born with such a talent for music that from infancy he could play by ear andimprovise at the piano. He was therefore given an extensive musical education and for ashort while planned a musical career. He in fact did teach music for two years at a boys’school. When he was about twelve years old, his mother lost her hearing; and there is littledoubt that this misfortune intensified his sympathy for the deaf and his lifelong interest inhelping to alleviate their difficulties in communicating. 6.In the summer of 1868, Melville Bell went on a lecture tour in the United States and Canada, leaving his son in full charge of his practice in London, where Alec also continuedhis studies at the university. When his father returned, Alec became a full partner in thework, continuing to teach while he studied the anatomy of the vocal apparatus at LondonUniversity. His work met with great success, and his reputation flourished. The work he didrevealed his outstanding talent for teaching. Adapted from Twelve Famous Americans (Compiled by Thomas Kral) 12033.

WEBQUEST 124LLATER BY MICHAEL FOSTER 1. Read the story and place these headings relating to the different parts in the space provided. A. ________________ It’s queer, the things you remember. When life has crumbled suddenly, and left you standing there, alone. It’s not the big important things that you remember when you come tothat: not the plans of years, not the love nor the hopes you’ve worked so hard for. It’s the littlethings that you remember then: the little things you hadn’t noticed at the time. The way ahand touched yours, and you too busy to notice; the hopeful little inflection of a voice youdidn’t really bother to listen to… John Carmody found that out, staring through the living-room window at the cheerful Tuesday-afternoon life of the street. He kept trying to think about the big, important things,lost now — the years and the plans, and the hopes. And the love. But he couldn’t quite get themfocused sharply in his mind, just now. Not this afternoon. They, those important things, were like a huge but nebulous background in his mind. All he could remember, now, was a queer little thing: nothing, really, if you stopped and thoughtabout it in the light of the years and the plans and the — the great love. It was only somethinghis little girl had said to him. One evening, two — perhaps three weeks ago. Nothing, if you looked at it rationally. The sort of thing that kids are always saying. But it was what he was remembering, now. B. ________________ That particular night, he had brought home from the office a finished draft of the annual stockholders’ report. Very important, it was. Things being as they were, it meant a great deal—to his future; to the future of his wife and his little girl. He sat down to reread it before dinner.It had to be right: it meant so much. And just as he turned a page, Marge, his little girl, came with a book under her arm. It was a green-covered book, with a fairy-tale picture pasted on it. And she said: “Look, Daddy.” a)Development of the drama b) Setting the scene for the story c) Conclusion d) Focus on the story e) Introducing the main characters, setting events in motionEXTENSIVE READING For Arts Students : Session 3 He glanced up and said: “Oh, fine. A new book, eh?” “Yes, Daddy,” she said. “Will you read me a story in it?”“No, dear. Not just now,” he said. Marge just stood there, and he read through the report. And Marge’s voice, with timid and hopeful little inflections, was saying: “But Mummy said you probably would, Daddy.” He looked up over the top of the typescript. “I’m sorry,"" he answered. “May be Mummy will read it to you. I’m busy, Dear.” “No,” Marge said politely. “Mummy is much busier, upstairs. Won’t you read me just this one story? Look— it has a picture. See? Isn’t it a lovely picture, Daddy?” “Oh, yes. Beautiful,” he said. “Now, that picture has class, hasn’t it? But I do have to work tonight. Some other time…” After that, there was quite a long silence. Marge just stood there, with the book open at the lovely picture. It was a long time before she said anything else. He read through two morepages… “But it is a lovely picture, Daddy. And the story looks so exciting,” Marge said.“I know,” he said. “Ah…mmmmmmm. Some other time. Run along, now.” “I’m sure you’d enjoy it, Daddy,” Marge said.“Eh? Yes, I know I would. But later.”“Oh,” Marge said. “Well, some other time, then. Will you, Daddy? Some other time?”“Oh, of course,” he said. But she didn’t go away. She still stood there quietly, like a good child. And after a long time, she put the book down on the chair, and said: “Well, whenever you get ready, just read it to yourself. Only read it loud enough so I can hear, too.” “Sure,” he said. “Sure. Later.” C. ________________ And that was what John Carmody was remembering. Now. Not the long plans of love and care for the years ahead. He was remembering the way a well-mannered child had touchedhis hand with timid little fingers, and said: “Just read it to yourself. Only read it loud enough so I can hear, too.” And that was why, now, he put his hand on the book. From the corner table where they had piled some of Marge’s playthings, picking them up from the floor where she had left them. The book wasn’t new any more, and the green cover was dented and thumbed. He opened it to the lovely picture. 125 126And reading that story, his lips moving stiffly with anguish to form the words, he didn’t try to think any more, as he should be thinking, about the important things: about his careful andshrewd and loving plans for years to come; and for a little while he forgot, even, the horror andbitterness of his hate for the half-drunken punk kid who had carelessly driven down the streetin a second-hand car — and who was now in jail on manslaughter charges. DD. ________________ He didn’t even see his wife, white and silent, dressed for Marge’s funeral, standing in the doorway, trying to make her voice say calmly: “I’m ready, dear. We must go.” Because John Carmody was reading: “Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a woodcutter’s hut, in the Black Forest. And she was so fair that the birds forgot their singing from the bough, looking at her. And there came a day when…” He was reading it to himself. But loud enough for her to hear, too.

Read the introduction and complete the table. Who? What ? Where ? Hoda Baraka , age 23 from Cairo, is studying an MSc in politics of the world economy at the London School of Economics (LSE) economy at theLondon School of Economics (LSE) 1.London universities' reputation for academic excellence is what most attracts foreign students to the capital, particularly those pursuinggraduate studies. As someone who completed an undergraduate degreeat an American university, then did postgraduate studies at the LSE, I can attest to the strengths of the British system. 2.While the US system exposes students to a wide range of subjects, the British system focuses more on building a solid base for critical thinking. This approach has proved tobe more fulfilling for graduate students - in the UK they are assessed more on thestrength and eloquence of their arguments, rather than on how much information theyhave absorbed. 3.The vibrancy of London life also features highly for most graduate students, and many universities highlight this when attempting to attract overseas students. Theexposure to different cultures and mindsets is matched by few universities in otherworld capitals. 4.Although most UK universities emphasise that their graduate programmes are only one year - an important advantage over their American counterparts - more studentsare considering part-time study, in view of the severe time constraints on full-timestudents. This enables them to take part in the many other activities that university lifeoffers. 5.However, there is a more important issue, which in my view is likely to dissuade an overseas student from studying in the UK: the financial outlay. The availability ofscholarships for international students is limited. Many fewer university scholarships aregiven to overseas students in Britain than in the US. These financial constraints reducethe pool of foreign students. This is a sad loss for the cultural diversity of university life 6.As someone who has been exposed to the American and British educational systems, the British system was more fulfilling and enlightening. But the financial headaches ofstudying here must be addressed if international students are to continue to choose theUK.

WWOMEN CHOOSE TO OPT OUTLesson 5 READING INTO WRITING 1. The following scrambled paragraphs make up an argumentative article. Reorder them so as to get a main thesis, 3 supporting arguments and a conclusion. Number each paragraph and label it. *See the sample answer provided. Paragraph N°………. Women used to be willing to devote their time, energy, and effort to the corporation's needs-at the expense of meeting their own professional goals. But notanymore. They're starting their own businesses in an effort to gain more freedom,recognition, money, opportunities and other rewards. According to the Center forWomen's Business research, the number of women-owned U.S. businesses grew attwice the rate of all firms between 1997 and 2002. Paragraph N°………. Expanding opportunities for women in leadership will require corporate change, as well as accommodations on the part of women themselves. Corporatecultures must support initiatives such as giving women high-visibility assignments,making gender diversity a part of succession planning and holding managersaccountable for women's advancements. While women managers can improve theirleadership ability by seeking out risky, high profile assignments. They should also tryto strengthen their leadership skills in order to meet new challenges. Paragraph N°………. Experts say corporate America isn't doing enough to keep women from walking out the door. Companies need to focus on providing flexibility, as well as continuingchallenges and opportunities for personal growth, to retain women whom they viewas high-potential or who are already significant contributors. It is essential that acompany should identify potential women managers early in their careers, rewardtheir contribution and five them grand positions. 156 **Paragraph N°1: Main thesis ( SAMPLE ANSWER) Increasingly, women managers are choosing to ""opt out"" when corporations fail to meet their professional needs. Opting out-the latest catch phrase within corporatecircles-describes the growing trend of leaving corporate positions for alternativecareer paths. A significant number of women managers are leaving large companies tostart their own businesses. In fact, women are quitting corporate jobs in favor ofentrepreneurship at twice the rate of men, according to Cheskin, a strategic marketresearch and consulting company. Paragraph N°………. Fifty-one percent of women business owners with prior private-sector experience cite the desire for more flexibility as the major reason for leaving corporatepositions, according to a study by Catalyst, a non-profit research and advisoryorganization working to advance professional women. Twenty-nine percent saidrestrictive glass-ceiling issues drove them out the door. Of those women, 44 % felttheir contributions were not recognized or valued.

Many scientists, engineers, physicians, and other professionals from developing countries work in Canada, the United States, and Western Europe. This phenomenon, oftenreferred to as the ""brain drain,"" was noticed as early as the 1960s and has been acontentious issue in the North-South debate ever since. One important implication of thebrain drain is that investment in education in a developing country may not lead to fastereconomic growth if a large number of its highly educated people leave the country. Also,efforts to reduce specific skill shortages through improved educational opportunities may belargely futile unless measures are taken to offset existing incentives for highly educatedpeople to emigrate.

The World Bank estimates that higher rates of international migration are inevitable: the phenomenon is a result of demographic trends that create a high demand for certainforms of labor in the developed world and a high supply of that labor in developing nations,and of declining communication and transportation costs. Moreover, international migrationis desirable: developed nations can hope to profit from a ""brain gain"" opposite the developingworld's ""brain drain,"" while developing nations enjoy the economic network benefits that theirexpatriates send home. It is important, reports the World Bank, that developed anddeveloping nations improve their cooperation on the issue-especially so that developingnations are not unnecessarily hurt by a brain drain of skilled workers.

Do you find their arguments convincing? 164RReverse Brain Drain: A Loss or A Gain? Africans swim against the brain drain tide. They left Africa in search of opportunity, to escape political persecution or to build a better life for their children.They thrive as they enjoytheir full rights in their homeland. But, sometimes after decades spent as immigrants orrefugees in the rich countries of the West, growing numbers of Africans are beginning tobring their expertise, talent and hopes for the future home to the world's poorest continent. Across the continent, returning African emigrants are filling key positions in government, education and business in a slow ""reverse brain drain"" that is gathering pace and thatofficials hope will sow the seeds of a broader economic revival. Returning Africans havemany reasons for coming home. But chief among them appears to be the chance tocontribute to countries that badly need their skills. www.homecomingrevolution.comC. TEXT C 1.

Name Country of origin Invention Benefits of the invention 168 22.Explain the invention in your own words. Egyptian-American scientist Ahmed H. Zewail won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for showing that a rapid laser technique can observe the motion of atoms in a molecule duringa chemical reaction. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Zewail was being honored for a revolution inchemistry through ""his pioneering investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, usingultra- short laser flashes, on the time-scale on which the reactions actually occur."" Theacademy said Zewail's work in the late 1980s led to the birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or0.000000000000001 of a second. 'No chemical reactions take place faster' ""We have reached the end of the road. No chemical reactions take place faster than this,"" the academy said. ""We can now see the movements of individual atoms as we imagine them.They are no longer invisible,"" the academy said. Zewail's technique, using what could be described as the world's fastest camera, worksmuch the same way as slow-motion action replays - they enable viewers to watch a footballmatch in detail. Applications of this technique include the design of molecular electroniccomponents, the study of the most delicate mechanisms in life processes and the productionof the medicines of the future, the academy said. A U.S. and Egyptian citizen, Zewail has held the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena since 1990. www .cnn.com B. Read this news story about James Hillier,inventor of the electron microscopeand answer the questions. 1.Who did James Hillier share the credit for inventing the electron microscope with? James Hillier, who shared the credit for inventing the electron microscope, died Monday at age 91. Hillier and another student, Albert Prebus, invented the microscope under the guidance of Professor Eli Burton while they were at the University of Toronto in 1938.The microscopemagnified objects 7,000 times their actual size, more than three times the magnificationpossible with optical microscopes. That made possible huge advances in many fields ofscience, including chemistry, biology and metallurgy. Hillier took the design to one of the companies in the U.S. after he graduated, starting a long career with the company. While there, he oversaw the development of thetechnology that the company used in its videodisc system. He received 41 patents. 169 Hillier was born in Brantford, Ontario, and gave $500,000 US - more than half the endowment -to the James Hillier Foundation, which provides 10 science scholarships tostudents from the area. Hillier died in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had lived for many years. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1997. The citation describes the electron microscope as ""one ofthe scientific wonders of the modern world.""

TThe waves beside them danced; but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: A poet could not but be ggay, In such a jocund company: I gazed--and gazed--but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought: For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eeye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffoddils.

Rephrase it in your own words. b) Simile A figure of speech involving a comparison between unlike things using like, as, or as though . An example: ""My love is like a red, red rose."" c) Hyperbole or exaggeration. d) Personification: endowing inanimate objects with human characteristics. 2.

Right away -you can taste and smell food better. Your breath smells better. Your cough goes away. - Quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other respiratory illnesses. - Quitting smoking saves money. To stop smoking is really a tough job to be done. Most smokers want toquit smoking, but find it difficult.

Feeling hungry is sometimes mistaken for the desireto smoke. * Start a money jar with the money you save by not buying cigarettes. * Constantly remind yourself of the negative effects of smoking and keepthem in mind, choose NOT TO ignore the problem.Benefits of quitting smoking How to quit smoking 196 1.

And whilst our advertising-soaked culturemakes it difficult for anyone to reject consumerism, it is foolish to claim that it hasbeen forced on people. If anything, people seem to love consumerism. They actively choose to embrace it. 205 206Par.2: ………………………………………… Consumerism doesn't inevitably bring happiness, fulfillment, or quality of life (asopposed to a high standard of living). People express nagging doubts about it,hinting that life in a consumer society is somehow alienating, unsatisfying andshallow. It isn't just empty nostalgia that makes us envy some of the qualities wesee in our less commercialized past, or in other less commercialized cultures.We see more integrated communities, a greater sense of belonging throughwork and neighbourhood. It's a powerful image, that of children once being ableto play in the street. And we suspect that pursuing consumerism has taken thesethings away from us - that we have collectively traded them in for material advantage. Par.3: ………………………………………… Consumerism thrives in a self-centred society, in which real freedom and realleisure are replaced by conformity and ""choice"". It also tries to persuade us thatthis is the only form that progress can take, and that to reject consumerism it isto reject every aspect of modern technological culture. So in order to afford allthe useless stuff, we end up working harder in jobs we don't like, making orselling things no one really needs. But we don't have to go down this line. It's notthe only way to create jobs, nor is it the only way to meet our commercial andphysical needs. Par.4: ………………………………………… The standard response to anticonsumerism is to see it as having less, to see itas a sacrifice, automatically meaning a drop in our quality of life. But 'lowering'our material standard of living, moving away from a culture dominated by alwayswanting more, does not inevitably mean lowering our quality of life: it may evenimprove it. Quality of life is not an inevitable result of a high income, and a lowerincome does not invariably result in a feeling of 'having less'. These things arerelative, once our basic needs have been met. It is important to distinguishbetween the feeling that a comparative lack of wealth brings, and the actual levelof income we have. And in turn to carefully distinguish between consumeristtrappings, and those products and innovations that really do improve life, orhealth, or communication. These things can still be available in a culture that hasturned its back on the excesses of consumerism. It's a simplistic myth to say youcannot have one without the other. www.enough.org.uk 3.

Road transport, including cars, is responsible for a quarter of all the UK's carbondioxide (CO 2) emissions. Transport also pollutes the air in towns and cities and although air quality in the UK is slowly improving, many areas still don't meet national and European air qualitystandards. And consider this: every year, around 32,000 people in the UK die prematurely asa result of poor air quality.You can help reduce CO 2emissions and air pollution by reducing the amount of fuel you use. That means walking, cycling or taking the bus for short journeys.

Read the text and ideentify the main ideas.employment dismissed - nine-to-five job - training - pay rise - work overtime - sacked - prospects - shift work - redundant - promoted - out of work Working hoursHard times Career ladder Some companies seem to be keener on going green than they are on their employees. A survey by management consultancy Hudson found that three-quarters of executives would not hesitate to fire employees to boost productivityand performance. One in six think they could get rid of 20 per cent of employeeswithout damaging performance or morale; nearly half reckon firing up to 5 percent a year would be a good thing. Even though only 4 per cent actually carry out this threat, it is still a revealing finding. This is what executives reallythink of their 'most valued asset'. Not only that, they utterly ignore their own contribution to their employees' underperformance, raising so many questionsit is hard to know where to begin. 228Only 38 per cent of employees feel managers and directors treat them with respect, and 66 per cent don't trust them. Around a quarter of employees rarelyor never look forward to going to work, and almost half are leaving or trying to.Researches suggest many managers aren't doing enough to keep their staffinterested. The result: underperformance and low productivity. A UK survey showed that in 2005 just 16 per cent of UK employees were 'positively engaged' - loyal and committed to the organisation. The rest werephysically present but psychologically absent. They express theirdisappointment by going sick, not trying, leaving or threatening to strike […]The culprit, says the survey, is poor management. 'Workers say they don't knowwhat is expected of them, managers don't care about them as people, their jobs aren't a good fit for their talents and their views count for little'.

Over the years Bess had lived each day as if there were no other. Now they were both pastsixty, the time for summing up. Lottie had a bank account that had never grownlean. Bess had the clothes on her back, and the rest of her worldly possessionsin a small suitcase.Lottie had hated being a child, seeing her parents struggling to make endsmeet. Bess had never seemed to notice. All she ever wanted was to go outsideand play. Lottie couldn't wait to grow up and buy herself the best of everything. 237[…] As soon as anyone would hire her, Lottie put herself to work. By the time she was twelve, she was working after school in a small variety store. Shebegan to bank her money, and her bankbook became her most preciouspossession. In her last year high she was faced with the choice of staying inschool or working full time. She made her choice easily. A job in hand was worth two in the future.Bess met Harry at school. He had no other ambition except to play music. ThatBess married Harry straight out of school was not surprising. That Lottie nevermarried at all was not really surprising either.Bess's married life was nothing to envy. She and Harry lived like gypsies. Harryplaying in second-rate bands all over the country, even getting himself and Bessstuck in Europe. They were often in rags and never in riches . Bess grieved because she had no child, not having sense enough to know she was better offwithout one. Lottie was certainly better off without nieces and nephews to feelsorry for. Very likely Bess would have left them on her doorstep.That Lottie had a doorstep was only because her boss, having bought a secondhouse, offered Lottie his first house at a price so low and terms so reasonablethat it would have been like losing money to refuse. She shut off the rooms shedidn't use. Her way of life was mean and miserly, but she did not know it. Shethought she lived frugally in her middle years so that she could live in comfortand ease when she most needed peace of mind. The years, after forty, beganto race. Suddenly Lottie was sixty, and retired from her job.Harry died abroad, in a third-rate hotel, leaving Bess nothing. There wasn't evenmoney for her travel home. Lottie, trapped by the blood tie, knew she wouldhave not only to send for her sister, but take her in when she returned. It didn'tseem fair that Bess should reap the harvest of Lottie's lifetime of self-denial. […] She was in the kitchen when Bess rang the bell. She went to the door, andBess stood before her. « Oh, Lottie, it's good to see you, » Bess said, but sayingnothing about Lottie's splendid appearance. Upstairs Bess, putting her shabbysuitcase, said « I'll sleep like a rock tonight, » without a word of praise for herlovely room. With the glow of good food in her stomach, Bess began to spin stories. They were rich with places and people, most of them very ordinary, all of themmagnificent. Her face reflected her telling, the joys and sorrows of herremembering, and above all, the love she lived by that enhanced the poorestplace, the humblest person.She said, « That's enough about me. How have the years used you? » « It was me who didn't use them, » said Lottie. « I saved for them. I forgot thebest of them would go without my ever spending a day or a dollar enjoyingthem. That's my life story in those few words, a life never lived. Now it's too nearthe end to try. »Bess said: « Don't count the years that are left us. You've too much catching upto waste a minute feeling sorry for yourself. »Lottie grinned, a real wide open grin, « Well to tell the truth I felt sorry for you.May be if I had any sense I'd feel sorry for myself, after all. I know I'm too old;but I'm going to let you show me how to live. » 2383. Who does each description apply to? Put a tick under the corresponding name. 4. Correct the folloowing false statements.

Never once has there been a complaint. There .......................................................................................................... 241Section 1 One morning the president of the Provincial Milk Company came to inspect theearly morning deliveries. Jacques pointed Pierre out to him and said: “Watchhow he talks to that horse. See how the horse listens and how he turns his headtoward Pierre? See the look in that horse's eyes? You know, I think those twoshare a secret. I have often noticed it. It is as though they both sometimeschuckle at us as they go off on their route. Pierre is a good man, MonsieurPresident, but he gets old. Would it be too bold of me to suggest that he beretired and be given perhaps a small pension?” he added anxiously. Section 2“But of course”, the president laughed. “I know his record. He has been on thisroute now for thirty years and never once has there been a complaint. Tell himit is time he rested. His salary will go on just the same”. But Pierre refused to retire. He was panic-stricken at the thought of not drivingJoseph every day. “We are two old men”, he said to Jacques. “Let us wear outtogether. When Joseph is ready to retire - then I, too, will quit”. Jacques, whowas a kind man, understood. There was something about Pierre and Josephwhich made a man smile tenderly. It was as though each drew some hiddenstrength from the other. When Pierre was sitting in his seat, and when Josephwas hitched to the wagon, neither seemed old. But when they finished theirwork, then Pierre would limp down the street slowly, seeming very old indeed,and the horse's head would drop and he would walk very wearily to his stall.Then one morning Jacques had dreadful news for Pierre when he arrived. Itwas a cold morning and still pitch-dark. The air was like iced wine that morningand the snow which had fallen during the night glistened like a million diamondspiled together.5. Do you expect Pierre to quit his job? Why? Why not? Now read section 2 . 1.Have you guessed right? Correct your guesses if necessary. 2.Pick out an expression showing Pierre was deeply shocked. 3.Find details proving Pierre and Joseph have grown old. 4.Identify two similes. 6. Guess what the sad piece of news might be. Read the next section and answer the questions in the margin. Section 3 Jacques said, “Pierre, your horse, Joseph, did not wake up this morning. He wasvery old, Pierre, he was twenty-five and that is like being seventy-five for a man”.“Yes”, Pierre said slowly. “Yes. I am seventy-five. And I cannot see Joseph again”. 242Did Pierre walk into the truck deliberately or accidentally? Read the last section to find out. 1.Have you guessed right? 2.What do you think of the way Jacques announced the sad news to Pierre? 3.Why do you think Pierre's eyes looked lifeless? 4.Paraphrase the following statement. The eyes were mirroring the grief that was in Pierre's heart and his soul. 5.What does 'neither' (inbold typein the text) refer to? 6.Guess what might have happened to Pierre.“Of course you can”, Jacques soothed. “He is over in his stall, looking very peaceful. Go over and see him.”Pierre took one step forward, then turned. “No … no … you don't understand,Jacques”. Jacques clapped him on the shoulder. “We'll find another horse just as good asJoseph. Why, in a month you'll teach him to know your route as well as Josephdid. We will.The look in Pierre's eyes stopped him. For years Pierre had worn a heavy cap,the peak of which came low over his eyes, keeping the bitter morning wind outof them. Now Jacques looked into Pierre's eyes and he saw something whichstartled him. He saw a dead, lifeless look in them. The eyes were mirroring thegrief that was in Pierre's hearts and his soul. It was as though his heart and soulhad died.“Take today off, Pierre,” Jacques said, but already Pierre was hobbling off downthe street, and had one been near one would have seen tears streaming downhis cheeks and have heard half-smothered sobs. Pierre walked to the cornerand stepped into the street. There was a warning yell from the driver of a hugetruck that was coming fast and there was the scream of brakes, but Pierreapparently heard neither . Section 4 Five minutes later an ambulance driver said, “He's dead. Was killed instantly”. Jacques and several of the milk-wagon drivers had arrived and they lookeddown at the still figure.“I couldn't help it,” the driver of the truck protested, “he walked right into mytruck. He never saw it, I guess. Why, he walked into it as though he were blind”. The ambulance doctor bent down. “Blind? Of course the man was blind. Seethose cataracts? This man has been blind for five years.” He turned to Jacques,“You say he worked for you? Didn't you know he was blind?” “No …. no …” Jacques said, softly. “None of us knew. Only one knew - a friendof his named Joseph … It was a secret, I think, just between those two”. 2431.

The standard response to anticonsumerism is to make it seem as having less, to see it as a sacrifice, automatically meaning a drop in our quality oflife. But 'lowering' our material standard of ( live) , moving away from a culture dominated by always ( want ) more, does not ( inevitable ) mean lowering our quality of life: it may even improve it. Quality of life is not aninevitable result of a ( height) income, and a lower income does not invariably result in a feeling of 'having less'. These things are ( relative ), once our ( basis ) needs have been met. If as one lone individual we try and consume a fairer share of the world's resources, and no one else does, weare (bind) to feel ill-at-ease. 2. Read the paragraph below and cross out 2 irrelevant sentences. Up until the late 19th century, a sprained ankle or a broken arm could only be diagnosed by means of physical examination. It all happened quite byaccident, when Alexander Fleming discovered that mould had killed bacteriain a lab dish he had forgotten to clean. It was W. Röntgen who first demonstrated the power of X rays in 1895. Thisimportant innovation made its ways into routine care a few years later andmade the diagnosing of international problems easier, safer and less painfulfor patients.When he presented his findings, nobody took notice of the potential benefits.All those scientists, who put their hearts and souls into research, tookimaging technology one step further with the development of ultrasound andCAT scan, which now help to diagnose disease early.

We must help the poor. Who looks after the old andthe sick ? The poor means poor people in general. It cannot refer to just one person or to a smallgroup. The +Adjective takes a plural verb. eg: the poor, the rich, the strong, the weak, the unemployed, the homeless, the deaf,the disabled, the living, the dead. The adjective can be modified by an adverb: The very rich / The severely disabled Some adjectives normally take an adverb/ The more/less fortunate / The mentally ill Abstract qualities We can use some adjectives after “ the” to refer to things which have an abstract quality.He reads a lot of books on the supernatural. The human race has a great thirst for the unknown. USED TO + VERB / BE USED TO + VERB + ING USED TO DO We use 'used to' for something that happened regularly in the past but no longer happens. I used to smoke a packet a day but I stopped two years ago. Ben used to travel a lot in his job but now, since his promotion, he doesn't. I used to drive to work but now I take the bus. We also use it for something that was true but no longer is. There used to be a cinema in the town but now there isn't. She used to have really long hair but she's had it all cut off. I didn't use to like him but now I do. 'Used to do' is different from 'to be used to doing' and 'to get used to doing' TO BE USED TO DOING SOMETHING We use 'to be used to doing' to say that something is normal, not unusual. I'm used to living on my own. I've done it for quite a long time. Hans has lived in England for over a year so he is used to driving on the left now. They've always lived in hot countries so they aren't used to the cold weather here. 264TO BE / GET USED TO DOING SOMETHING We use 'to get used to doing' to talk about the process of something becoming normalfor us.I didn't understand the accent when I first moved here but I quickly got used to it. She has started working nights and is still getting used to sleeping during the day. I have always lived in the country but now I'm beginning to get used to living in the city. THE SUBJUNCTIVE FORMUse the simple form of the verb : the infinitive without ""to"" with all the subjects(singular or plural) USE The Subjunctive is used to emphasize urgency or importance. It is used aftercertain expressions and in formal, impersonal English. In more informal language we commonly use should. This form is used more frequently in British English and is most common after theverbs ""suggest,"" ""recommend"" and ""insist.""Examples :The police insisted the car should be moved / be moved immediatelyI suggest that he study . Is it essential that we bethere? We recommended that she jointhe committee. Verbs followed by the Subjunctive to command to demand to insist to propose to recommend to suggest EXAMPLES: Dr. Dave demanded that John prepare his research paper before the end of the month. Brian proposed that Frank beat the party. The teacher insists that the students arrive on time. Expressions followed by the Subjunctive It is best (that) It is crucial (that) It is desirable (that) It is essential (that) It is imperative (that) It is important (that) It is recommended (that) It is urgent (that) It is vital (that) It is a good idea (that) It is a bad idea (that) 265EXAMPLES : It is crucial that you beon time for a job interview. It is urgent that she take her son to the doctor. It is imperative that he attend all the lectures. RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE / NON-RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE WHAT IS A RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE? Arestrictive clause provides essential information about the subject of a sentence : it restricts the meaning of a sentence by identifying the specific qualities of the noun or pronoun. Example: The book which is on the desk is mine. Here the restrictive clause ""which is on the desk "" tells which book is mine. There might be other books in other places, but this sentence is only concerned with thebook that is on the bureau. Do not use commas with a restrictive clause.Correct: The book which is on the desk is mine.Incorrect: The book, which is on the desk , is mine. In this example, the restrictive clause identifies the subject of the sentence: The girl who is picking flowers is beautiful. The adjective clause tells which girl is in love; there could be a dozen other girls in the area, but only one is picking flowers. Restrictive clauses do not need commas. WHAT IS A NON-RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE?Non-restrictive clauses provide descriptive information that isn't essential to the meaning of the sentence. Examples:The detective, who was short and fat, took down my statement. The car, which was brand-new, was parked in the garage. In these examples, the non-restrictive clauses, which are highlighted, provide extra information about the main subject of the sentence. Non-restrictive clauses are enclosed with commas 266INVERSION Inversion refers to an irregular verb placement form. Generally, an inversion is used to stress the uniqueness of an event and beginswith a negative. Use of Question Form Inversion refers to the use of question form ( auxiliary + subject + main verb ) instead of the standard positive sentence structure (i.e. He goes to work every day) :Examples Not only do I enjoy classical music, but I also have a season ticket to the symphony. Seldom has the boss been so upset! In this case, the question form is substituted for standard sentence structure in astatement. Negative Adverbials Time expressions: never, rarely, seldom These time expressions are used with a perfect form and often include comparatives: ExamplesNever has she been moresuccessful ! Seldom has he seen anything stranger. T ime expressions: hardly , barely , no sooner , or scarcely These time expressions are used when there are a succession of events in the past. Examples Scarcely had I got out of bed when the doorbell rang. No sooner had he finished dinner, when she walked in the door. After 'Only' Expressions such as 'only after', 'only when', 'only then', etc. 'Only' is used with a time expression. Examples Only then did I understand the problem. Only after understanding the situation does the teacher make a comment. After 'Little' 'Little' is used in a negative sense. ExamplesLittle did he understand the situation. Little have I read concerning nanotechnology. Inverted Conditional Forms Sometimes conditional forms are inverted as a means of sounding more formal.In this case, the conditional 'if' is dropped and the inverted forms take the placeof the 'if clause' . Examples Had he understood the problem, he wouldn't have committed those mistakes. (If he had understood the problem, he wouldn't have committed those mistakes.)Should he decide to come, please telephone. (If he decides to come, please telephone.) 267NEED / NEEDN'T/ NEEDN'T HAVE We use needn't and don't have to say that something is unnecessary Youneedn't come early. You do not have to make an appointment. Need as an ordinary verb: used to express necessity, obligation. Wedon't need to leave now. I need to get some sleep. Do you need to show your identity card? Needn't have done / didn't need to: used to talk about an unnecessary pastaction. The action happened but we know that it was unnecessary.You needn't have cooked / you didn't need to cook so much food. (You cooked much food but it wasn't necessary).Didn't need to: means that the action didn't happen.Wedidn't need to make any sandwiches. We knew that people were bringing their own. (We didn't make them because it wasn't necessary.) COULD HAVE We can use 'could have' to talk about something somebody was capable ofdoing but didn't do. I could have gone to Oxford University but I preferred Harvard. She could have married him but she didn't want to. They could have bought a house here 20 years ago but chose not to. Often, there is a sense of criticism. You could have phoned me to let me know. They could have helped me instead of just sitting there. I could have done more to help you. Sorry. We can use 'couldn't have' to talk about something we were not capable of doing. I couldn't have managed without you. I couldn't have got the job. He was always going to appoint his nephew. I couldn't have enjoyed myself more. Thank you for a lovely day. We can use 'could have' to speculate about what has happened. (We can alsouse 'may have' or 'might have' in these situations.) She could have taken the earlier train. Simon could have told her. They could have overheard what we said. We can also use 'could have' to speculate about something that didn't happen. You could have broken your neck, jumping out the window like that. He could have hurt somebody, throwing a bottle out of the window like that. I could have done well in my exam if I'd worked harder . Need + to + verb = obligation / necessity Needn't + verb = absence of necessity in the present Needn't + have + past participle = absence of necessity in the past. You did something but it wasn't necessary 268You can also use 'could have' to talk about possible present situations that have not happened. He could have been Manager now but he got involved in a big financial problem. They could have been the market leaders now if they had taken his advice. I could have been earning a lot as an accountant but the work was just too boring CLAUSES OF CONTRAST Clauses of Contrast give information that contrasts with or opposes the facts in themain clause in an unexpected way. These clauses can be introduced withconjunctions such as although, (even) though, however, etc . some of these words and phrases introduce the known or background information; others introduce theunexpected contrast. Even though it was much too hot, I went out. Everyone played well. However, we still lost the game; While can replace although: While I see your point, I still think you're wrong. The prepositions in spite of and despite are followed by a noun phrase or -ing form : In spite of the price, I've decided to buy the car. Despite feeling dreadful, Max went swimming. WHO , WHOM , OF WHICH Who and whom as relative pronouns. A relative pronoun must refer to a noun preceding it.The man whom she most admires will be here tonight. In this example whom is a relative pronoun to MAN. The candidate will choose who will act as campaign director. In this example who is a personal pronoun. Correct usage of the who/whom pronouns presents difficulties. The followingguidelines and examples may help you determine which one to use.If a pronoun (he, she, it, they) could serve as the subject of the who/whom clause, use who . In the example above, who is part of a clause that modifies the subject of the sentence, John Smith. If who were replaced with he or John Smith, the clausewould make sense and reinforce the idea that who not only refers to the subject ofthe sentence but could also replace it. When a pronoun functions as the object of a clause, use whom .John Smith, who was respected by all the pupils, was the best teacher in the school. John Smith, whom all the pupils respected, was the best teacher in the school. 269In the example above, the whom clause modifies the subject of the sentence. It differs from the first example, however, in that whom functions as the object of the clause in which it exists. 'All the pupils' is the subject in the clause, while whom (referring to John Smith) is the object the verb respected refers to . When a preposition (in, of, on, without, at, from) precedes the pronoun, use whom or which. PARALLELISM When two elements of a sentence are similar in meaning, you should expressthem in parallel form. In other words, all linked words should match in form. By using parallel structure, we both clarify the meaning of our writing and add symmetry to it. Parallel structure joins and emphasizes equally important ideas. 1. Co-ordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, for, so, yet). She likes dancing and swimmingHe wanted to buy a new car or a small apartment. 2. Correlative Conjunctions (either …or, neither…nor, both…and, not only …but also, whether…or) We can either watch a film or listen to music.Neither my mother nor my father speaks English fluently.My brother is not only intelligent but also hard-working.You will need both English and German for this job. 3. Words in a series She reads novels, short stories and plays.They bought a laptop, a webcam, a flash disk and a mouse. 4. Comparisons and contrasts using than or as (i.e., more than, as much as) I don't like French as much as I like English.We practise basketball more than we practise volleyball. 5. Function words: A function word that begins one clause must begin the others. prepositions (to, by, in, for) : They take part in debates and in forums. articles (a, an, the) : The documentary was about the Native Americans and the Aborigines.the infinitive (to) : She decided to be serious, to work hard and to attend all the lectures.introductory words (that, who, which, because, when) : I believe that she is innocent and that she deserves our apologies.- The anonymous donor, of whom we speak , gave ten million dollars to help the refugees. - The lady to whom I made the promise to work hard is my English teacher. - The book, from which I took the information , is a thesaurus. - The secondary school, to which they go , was built in 1965. 270This timeline tenses chart provides a handy reference sheet to English tenses and their relationship to one another and the past, present and future. Conjugated verbs are highlighted in bold. Tenses whichare rarely used in everyday conversation are marked by an asterisk (*). TIMELINE SIMPLE ACTIVE SIMPLE PASSIVEPROGRESSIVE / CONTINUOUS ACTIVEPROGRESSIVE / CONTINUOUS PASSIVE PAST TIME We had already eaten when they came. The car had been sold twice before I bought it.PAST PERFECTIhad been waiting for four hours when the doctor arrived.. I saw him at the station last week. PASTI was reading a book when she arrived.

FUTURE PERFECTShe will have been working here for two months by the end of next week. FUTURE TIME 271COLLOCATIONS, METAPHORS AND IDIOMS COLLOCATIONS 1. What is collocation ? Collocation is the way in which particular words tend to occur or belongtogether. We say that words that occur together frequently « collocate ».Words that do notcollocate almost never occur together. If we try, they sound unnatural and wrong : Time speeds / travels / rides / moves ( = they don't collocate). Time flies / goes by / wears on / passes (= they collocate). There are no rules or logical explanations for why some words collocate and othersdon't. For example, we can talk about an academic year but not a studying year.Discussions can be productive or fruitful but not prolific. METAPHORS A metaphor is a combination of vocabulary items used in an imaginative way to describe something or someone , in order to show that the 2 things have the samequalities and to make the description more powerful.For example, her sunny smile, have a big head, purr with delight, a sundrenched beach, pull strings. 1- Words used metaphorically:Here are some examples of words being used metaphorically:I hope this will have cushioned your loss. Seeing him on stage fired my enthusiasm. She just froze when she saw her ex-boyfriend. He's always trumpeting his own successes.2- Compound adjectives and nouns as metaphors:Some compounds are always metaphorical - they have a meaning that each partof the compound doesn't have a bloodbath is never 'a bath full of blood'; thecompound has only the meaning of 'a massacre'. Other examples of compoundsthat are always metaphorical include:mind games mind-reader narrow-minded warm-hearted bone-dryhard-bitten IDIOMS An idiom is a group of words whose meaning is different from the meanings of the individual words.Examples : The life and soul of the party: the most amusing or interesting person at a party. Make it to the top: be successful. Meeting of minds: a close understanding between people with similar ideas. All of a sudden: quickly and unexpectedly. 272IRREGULAR VERBS 3 IDENTICAL FORMS 2 IDENTICAL FORMSBASE FORM PAST PAST PARTICIPLE bet burst broadcast cost cut hit hurt let put set shut split spreadbet (betted) burst broadcast (-ed) cost cut hit hurt let put set shut split spreadbet (betted) burst broadcast (-ed) cost cut hit hurt let put set shut split spread BASE FORM PAST PAST PARTICIPLE bend lend send spend smell spell burn learn build spill spoil have lay make pay say deal dream leanleap meanbent lent sent spent smelt / smelled spelt / spelled burnt / burned learnt / learned built spilt / spilled spoilt / spoiled had laid made paid said dealt dreamt / dreamed leant / leanedleapt / leaped meantbent lent sent spent smelt / smelled spelt / spelled burnt / burned learnt / learned built spilt / spilled spoilt / spoiled had laid made paid said dealt dreamt / dreamed leant / leanedleapt / leaped meant 273read lead leave bleed breed feed flee speed creep keep sleepweep feel meet dig stick win cling string swing wring hang strike seek teach bring think catch buy fight sit spit stand lose shoot light slide bind find wind shine get sell tell hold hear run comeread led left bled bred fed fled sped / speeded crept kept sleptwept felt met dug stuck won clung strung swung wrung hung / hanged struck sought taught brought thought caught bought fought sat spat stood lost shot lit / lighted slid bound found wound shone got sold told held heard ran cameread led left bled bred fed fled sped / speeded crept kept sleptwept felt met dug stuck won clung strung swung wrung hung / hanged struck / stricken sought taught brought thought caught bought fought sat spat stood lost shot lit / lighted slid bound found wound shone got sold told held heard run come 2743 DIFFERENT FORMS BASE FORM PAST PAST PARTICIPLE begin drink ring sing sink spring stink swim freeze speak steal break choose rise drive ride write bite hide draw blow grow know throw fly shake take forget tread bear tear swear began drank rang sang sank / sunk sprang / sprung stank swam froze spoke stole broke chose rose drove rode wrote bit hid drew blew grew knew threw flew shook took forgot trod bore tore sworebegun drunk rung sung sunk sprung stunk swum frozen spoken stolen broken chosen risen driven ridden written bitten hidden drawn blown grown known thrown flown shaken taken forgotten trodden borne / born torn sworn Tipsforunderstanding unfamiliar words Guessing unknown words can be achieved through: a-Using word parts example: un / believ(e) / able negative prefix root verb suffix used to get adjectives The meaning I get is approximately: something I do not believe.The word parts (un + verb + able) represent clues of the meaning of thewhole word. b- Suffixes indicate what type of word it is.

3Preface
PERFORM TO LEARN is a book for the Second Year Secondary Education. It is based
on the following key principles:
The learner is considered as a manager of his/her own  improvement, capable of taking
the learning process as his/her own responsibility. She/he should therefore be encouraged todevelop autonomy and  critical thinking. What the learner does and how she/he processesinformation during the lesson is to be the focal point of the teaching/learning process.
The book is organised in themes to give the learner a chance to explore and recycle
language through various activities . Furthermore, it enables him/her to smoothly transit from
one lesson to the next  without getting confused.
Certain formats are repeated throughout the book in order to help the learner and give
him/her the confidence that comes with familiarity.
For a balanced learning, the four main skills are considered of equal importance and
have been almost evenly spread throughout the book with a balanced weighting.
The book consists of a preface, a book map, a diagnostic test, a review module, a series
of 30 lessons, 10 supplementary lessons for Arts and 10 for Economics branches and anappendix.
We do hope the practitioners and the learners will find the material relevant, useful and
varied. More important though, we hope the material will be exploited so as to interest  thelearner and  lead him/her towards the ultimate goal: Learning how to learn.

14Interpretation :
A, E, F, H, J, P, R =True.This basically indicates you are a self-motivated, hard-working learner. It also
indicates your desire to socialise, to meet other races and cultures. This is what language is for. Theperfect student. A talker and a walker.B, D, G, I, K, N =True. You strongly feel you are obliged to learn, which is not self-motivation. Don’t
worry, but remember that a good learner must want to achieve for himself and must not blame his/herpoor performance on others/external factors.C, O =True.This can mean that you are a perfectionist. You pay attention to formal details. This can
be good, but it can also be an obstacle to communication. An anxious talker.G, I, K, L, N =True.This means you are not active enough. You are just an occasional talker.
M = True. It happens to everybody at the beginning, but don’t worry you’ll feel better after a few classes.
Q =True. This is a big issue. But how can you talk about the world with a few phrases? You may be a
traditional learner. Remember, the ultimate aim of English is to communicate.S =True. Bingo! It is said that girls work harder at languages than boys.
Some of the above statements may apply to several interpretations.

Animal lovers value their pets. They would prefer the company of their pets to a human
companion. Besides providing companionship, owning a pet has actually saved lives!
Animals are thought to have strong feelings or intuition that humans don't.  Some of the amazing
examples of the strong feelings of animals are those where they have sensed a near future self-killing or suicide and saved human's life.
According to Sheldrake, when one woman with marital problems decided to end her life by
overdosing on pills, her 15-year-old Spaniel who had been sleeping ran in and, for the first time inhis life, began snarling viciously and barking at her
She was so shocked by his behavior that she put the bottle down and sat on the  sofa. The dog
immediately jumped up next to her and began frantically licking her face, while wagging his wholebody.
Animals also decrease feelings of loneliness and isolation in making residents more likely to smile,
talk, reach out people and experience a greater sense of well being.

4My hometown is famous for several amazing natural features. First, it is well (know - known
- knowing) for the Wheaton River, which is very wide and beautiful. On either side of this river,
which is 175 feet wide, are many willow trees which have long branches that can move (grace -
gracefully - graceful) in the wind. In autumn the leaves of these trees fall and cover the
riverbanks like golden snow. Also, (at - on - in ) the other side of the town is Wheaton Hill , (who
- which- whose) is unusual because it is very steep. Even though it is steep, climbing this hill is
not dangerous because there are some firm rocks along the sides that can be used as stairs.There are no trees around this hill, so it stands clearly against the sky and can be (see - seen -
saw) from many miles away.
The third amazing feature is the Big Old Tree. This tree stands two hundred feet tall and is
probably about (six hundred years old - six hundreds  years  old - six hundreds year old) .
These three landmarks are amazing and make my hometown a famous place.

What qualities did Whitney get from her friends ?I want to be remembered as someone who saw life full of possibilities. I want to be remembered as
someone who readily gave appreciation and support towards others.  I want to be remembered assomeone who planned a future out for herself and followed it. Making a clear path for myself will notbe easy. Support from my parents and friends encourage me to keep on trying.
Being with my family gives me a feeling of safety. Having the opportunity to talk to family, when I
need to, helps me to be open towards them. When I have a question to ask my parents, they are alwayswilling to listen to what I have to say. When I do get in trouble, they do not yell at me, but tell me theconsequences that might happen. Loving and caring for each other is what holds us together. A familyis not a family without love. 
Talking about my future and getting school accomplished, I would have to thank my parents for their
support. My parents support me as I choose what I want to do with my future. « What do I have to doin order to become a pediatrician? » .Without hesitation they tell me how much school I would have togo through. To believe in myself, I would have to be self-confident enough to achieve my goal.
Being around the people I care about has expanded my knowledge of life. My friends have taught
me to value our friendship making sure they know I will always be there. My friends and I help eachother out when we are stressed and having a difficult time. 
Without my parents and friends I would be lost, they are the ones who guide me through life.

24From an early age I’d known I never wanted children of my own.
It just happened when my Mr Right came along with a ready-madefamily.
Jennifer Middledich was
always the stepmother then,on Mother’s Day, Came herwell-deserved reward.The Day I Stopped Being a Stepmum
(Part one)
Suddenly, aged 20, I became stepmum to three children :
Jay, nine, Dan, seven, and Kerry- the baby, aged five. At first, it was hard, to say the least. The childrenwould do anything to test my patience.         
I’ve never tried to be anything other than a stepmum. The kids have their own mum and I’ve always
respected that. I was always ‘Jenny ‘. As time passed however, it was wonderful to be accepted intotheir lives.
The older they grew, the fonder I grew of them, and the less I regretted never having children of my
own. I loved them as if they were my own.              
When Kerry announced she was having a baby, Steve and I were really happy. Kerry was like the
daughter I’d never had.
So, when little Bradley arrived, I was knocked sideways by the outpouring of love I felt towards him.
I’ve never been maternal but, holding him in my arms, I just melted.
(Part two)
On Mother’s Day last year , I was watching from the window, waiting for little Bradley, aged one to
arrive. “ They’re here, they’re here,” I shrieked excitedly, as the car pulled up.
Eagerly, I ran out of the front door, and made straight for the car’s rear door to get Bradley out of
his baby seat. “Hello BJ,” I said, as Bradley grinned up at me. I always called him BJ_ short for BradleyJones.
Clutched carefully in his  little hand was a bunch of paper flowers. “Give her the flowers,” Kerry
urged gently.
He gave me the bouquet and sweetly said “Nan.”I stared at him, astonished and in tears, then I  gently took him out of his chair and held him to me
tightly.” I’m Bradley’s Nan, I’m Bradley’s Nan;” I kept repeating to myself with delight ” he’s just said so.”Then, holding my precious flowers carefully, I went back inside with my grandson. 
It was the happiest moment of my entire life. Since then  I’ve become a grand-mother.

b-Justify your choice.
Hard to decide
I have no intention to leave school in the near future because high qualifications are requested
if you want to find an attractive job these days. I have often wondered however whether I shouldcontinue to live with my parents when I finish university, or whether I’d better leave home to be on
my own .
On the one hand, it would be terribly tempting to live by myself, rent my own flat, see whoever
I want, and go out whenever I please. My parents wouldn’t know what I’m doing and so theywouldn’t be able to criticize this or that aspect of my lifestyle. By living alone I would also find outwhether I can really manage alone without always falling back on Mum and Dad for their financial
help or their judicious advice. All in all, it would probably be the best way to see if I’m really an adultor not, but then I would have to become more level-headed and more organised than I am now !
On the other hand I may choose to stay at home when I leave school. I know that my parents
wouldn’t mind in the least and I can actually see quite a few advantages to this situation. First of all,it would be safer than to move out and look for adventure. Besides, I’ve always felt at ease with my
parents because they are rather open-minded for their age and because I know that I can count
on them whenever I face a difficult situation. It seems only logical then to take advantage of thiscomfortable environment in order to make my life easier!
All things considered, it seems to me that the best time to settle down on one’s own doesn’t
necessarily coincide with the time when one leaves school. As for me, why should I decide to moveout of my parents’ house if I’m still happy to be there?

Financial Markets
A financial market is a place where firms and individuals enter into
contacts or buy a specific product such as a stock or bond . Buyers
seek to buy at the lowest available price and sellers seek to sell at thehighest available price.
Personal benefit, sometimes called economic self-interest,
motivates many people to invest in stocks and bonds. In the 1990s,about two of every five persons in the U.S.A own stock incorporations. People invest because they believe that it is possible togain more investments than from a basic bank savings program.

Read the text and do the activities below.
Jackie Jones, 40, a part-time medical secretary from Essex, England, met up with her old school
friend, Heather Gooch, three years ago, after finding her through the Friends Reunited website.
Heather and I have known each other since we were five, but lost touch when Heather left school
at 16, to work as a waitress, and I stayed on to do A-levels. We’d been such good friends at school, Iwas curious to see what she was doing now and hopeful that we would renew our friendship. So whenI saw something in the paper about the website, Friends Reunited, I logged on straight away. It wasvery easy to use. You create your own password, and then look up your school and the year you leftand up comes a list of names.
I was very excited when I found Heather’s name in the list. We e-mailed each other at first, then
spoke on the phone and decided to meet up. It was 23 years since we’d last seen each other, but therewas no awkwardness. We took up exactly where we’d left off. It was incredible at that time. It was asif we’d never been apart. We still have lots in common-we laugh at the same things, like the samemusic and our lives seem to have taken a similar path. She’s my best friend again.
We e-mail each other every day and I see her at least once a week – we go to restaurants, wine
bars, the cinema, and go shopping together. Heather’s family spent Christmas Day with us last yearbecause our husbands and daughters get on, too. It’s great. It’s a deeper kind of friendship than theone we had at school, which I think comes with age and experience. I feel I could turn to her for supportand hope she would do likewise.
We’ve met up with a few other friends through the website and last year we organized a reunion.
Nearly 40 people came then, which was lovely.
When you have children, there was not always time to keep in touch with all your old friends. I’d
made new friends through their primary school, but it’s lovely to have renewed a friendship from adifferent part of my life, and when we’re together we feel like we’re going to keep in touch forever now.

Classify your words into the table below.
Study the words in the table below. Cross out those you can’t associate with
communication .
Read Text One and then do the activities below.
Text 1 : The texter
Although text messaging started out as a teen craze , it’s not just the
under-24s who are hooked . From organising mass demonstrations to
confessing undying love, the power of text messaging knows no limits,according to WAN2TLK?’s author, Gabrielle Mander. The text messager iseither trying to be fun and amusing or discreet,” she says.
Social psychologist Dr Adam Johnson believes text messages provide an uninhibited form of
communication and that we’re much more likely to flirt as a result. “Hidden aspects of ourselves surfacebecause of the visual anonymity involved with texting,” he says.
Gabrielle Mander believes men are especially comfortable with text messaging as it allows them to
be more romantically open. “Men don’t like being overheard or talking about their feelings face to face,”she explains. “They won’t say, I love you,’ on the phone, but they will in a text message; “Women alsoenjoy the discreet appeal of texting. “ A text message can’t be overheard like a phone call. And you candestroy the evidence quickly,” says Mander.
Text messagers around the world now share jokes, secrets and feelings- but from a safe distance.
According to Dr Adam Johnson, text messagers can be insecure , shy or needy. “Sometimes they’re
desperate to receive messages that give them security or comfort,” he explains.

the text.
a-Text messaging was started by teenagers.
b-Text messaging can be used for various purposes.
c-Text messaging makes people more open and less discreet.
d-People like text messaging because they can easily destroy the evidence.
Read the text again and replace the words in bold face with words from the box
below without changing the original meaning.
LANGUAGE PRACTICE
• Look at paragraph two in text one and study the following two sentences. 
What is the  relation between the two clauses in each sentence?
a-Text messages provide an uninhibited form of communication and we’re much more
likely to flirt as a result.      
b-Hidden  aspects of ourselves surface because of the visual anonymity involved with
texting.

b-She hadn’t received the first prize and she was disappointed as a result.
c-She won’t be able to attend the ceremony since her husband has recently died.
d-The book was so captivating that I had to read it all.
e-We had such a wonderful weather during our holiday that we hated to fly back home.
Read the following text then refer back to Text One and find out the advantages
a texter can have and an e-mailer can’t .
Text 2 : The e-mailer
E-mailers desire control, according to Anne Warfield. “E-mail offers a clear, concise way to get
the job done on your own terms. You can be in control of the content, when you send it and whenyou respond to messages. If you love e-mail, you’re probably a strategic planner and very goaloriented. When you enter a meeting you probably take up lots of space, spreading your papers onthe table.”
Nicky Stanton, an engineer at BT, believes the e-mailer always has something specific to say-
interesting, when you consider that one in ten women ditches her lover by e-mail.” E-mailers aremore interested in what they are saying than in how the other person reacts. The e-mailer makesless effort than the texter_ they don’t have to pick up a phone or find a number. They are at theirdesks and just click a button,” she says. “But the e-mailer can’t deal with conflict. The e-mailer whofires a member of staff or ditches a lover can’t handle emotionally the bad reception or hurt theyknow they’ve caused.”

Johnstone missed his girlfriend so much he flewback to Britain from Australia to propose to her.The problem is she did the same in the oppositedirection.
2He and Amy Dolby even managed to miss
each other when they sat in the same airportlounge in Singapore at the same time to wait forconnecting flights.
3Dolby, heartbroken when she arrived at
Johnstone’s apartment to find he had flown toLondon, told Times: “It was as though someonewas playing a cruel joke on us.
4“He is the most romantic person I have
ever known. I think our problem is that we areboth quite impulsive people. We are alwaystrying to surprise each other.”
5After an 11,000-mile flight across the
globe, she was greeted by Johnstone’sastonished flat mate asking what she was doingthere.
6“The awful truth dawned when I found that
Ian’s rucksack and most of his clothes weremissing. I sat on the end of his bed and cried myeyes out,” she said.7Johnstone, a 27-year-old bricklayer, had
taken a year off to travel round Australia. But hewas missing Dolby, a 26-year-old secretary, somuch he got a job on a Sydney building site andstarted saving for a surprise.
8He then flew to Britain and went to her
apartment armed with an engagement ring,champagne and flowers.
9“I really missed Amy and I’d been thinking
about her all the time. I thought she was windingme up when she phoned me from Australia,” hesaid.
10Johnstone then asked Dolby to marry
him on the phone. “I didn’t know whether tolaugh or cry but I accepted,” she said.
11Dolby was given a tour of Sidney by
Johnstone’s friends before sending her wearyway home. Johnstone had to stay in Britain fortwo weeks because he could not change histicket;

A Happy Accident
I was due to start working for a law firm. I had passed all the
interviews. And had been notified to report for work the following Monday.On Sunday, my sister and I were walking in the park. When a blond boywho had a crush on me but was too bashful to speak demonstrated hisaffection by throwing an apple core which struck me in the eye. When Iwoke up Monday morning, I had the most beautiful black eye you eversaw. Too embarrassed to start a new job looking like that, I called in sick.They called back to say that the position had been filled by someone else.The next job I found was the one that brought your father and metogether. I often think of that apple core and wonder what my life wouldbe like if it had never been thrown.

Child Labour
1The International Labour Organization (ILO) has estimated that 250 million children between the
ages of five and fourteen work in developing countries-at least 120 million on a full time basis. Mostworking children in rural areas are found in agriculture; many children work as domestics; urbanchildren work in trade and services, with fewer in manufacturing and construction.
2Working children are the objects of extreme exploitation. They work the longest hours and are
the worst paid of all labourers. They endure work conditions which include health hazards andpotential abuse. Many of them endure lives of pure deprivation. They’re deprived of the simple joysof childhood which together with hard work hinder their physical and mental development.
3Children work for a variety of reasons, the most important being poverty. Though children are
not well paid, they still serve as major contributors to family income. They work to ensure thesurvival of their family and themselves.
4Schooling problems also contribute to child labour. Many times children seek employment
simply because there’s no access to schools (distance, no school at all). When there’s access, thelow quality of the education often makes attendance a waste of time for the students. 
Extract from “World Bank Report.”

The Colour of Nutrition
1Colorize your diet. That is the latest advice from nutrition experts who have studied the health-
promoting properties of the vast spectrum of colourful fruits and vegetables now available.
2Two recently published books "" What Color Is Your Diet ? "" and "" The Color Code "", both
emphasize the importance of increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, and the need tochoose broadly among the richly colored options. The reward in terms of health and weight can beconsiderable.
3Nearly all fruits and vegetables are naturally very low in fat, loaded with filling fiber and with
natural chemicals that can help protect against heart disease, cancer, age-related cognitive decline
and cataracts of the eyes. Fruits and vegetables, with their vivid skins, are highly recommended byboth books for their health-promoting benefits. And even the paler members of thiscommunity_garlic, onions, cabbage, celery and the like_ have notable health-promoting virtues.TheColour Code "" gives a detailed account of the protective chemicals nature has bestowed upon
various fruits and vegetables and how these chemicals can positively affect our different organs.
4Fruits and vegetables come closer than any other category of food to behaving like a fountain
of youth. Yet, not all members of this community are alike. The authors of "" The Colour Code "" dividefruits and vegetables into four broad colour groups: red, orange-yellow, green and blue-purple, eachwith a different set of health promoting virtues.
5The message is clear for both books, and "" Pigment Power "" is what it is all about. We need
to include as many plant-based colours in our daily diet as possible. In many cases, that meanseating the colourful skins, the richest sources of protective nutrients, along with the paler flesh. Sotry to avoid peeling foods like apples, peaches and eggplant or you will lose their most concentratedsource of beneficial chemicals.

SpeakingMoney and Evil
1Group work: Read the following statements and select
the ones you strongly agree with. Prepare arguments tosupport your choice and share with the rest of the class.
a- Money is the root of all evil.
b- Having much money often leads to corruption.
c- Money is the source of happiness. 
d- Poverty is the root of all evil.
e- Having little money leads to crime.
f- Being rich is a sign of God’s choice.
g- When you have money you have power.
Read the text, then do the activities below.
We must admit there is some truth in the famous saying: “money is the root of all evil”. First
having much money certainly gives its possessor a feeling of superiority and self-satisfaction thatmay lead to tyranny and corruption. Very rich people generally think they can buy everything, eventhe honoured dignity of other people. They are alas; often successful because money has a strongappeal and many individuals can’t resist the magic power of money, even if they have to do thedirtiest things. Second, if you have enough money to pay for everything you want right away, youtend to become tired of pleasure. Because you can have things easily without being really sureyou like them or you need them, they start losing their values for you and you start missing thepleasures of life. 
But on the other hand, we can also say that the “lack of money is the root of all evil”. If  you can’t
afford a nice place to live in, if you are unable to provide your family with a decent standard of livingyou may resort to borrowing, cheating and even stealing to make ends meet. In such situationssome people may also turn to drinking to forget their worries and drown their misery. Some otherpeople may even resort to violence, crime and anarchy in order to get revenge on rich people andthe cruel world.
It is clear therefore, that both plenty of money and the lack of it are evil. They may both lead to
social calamities and moral decline. A better attitude towards money is to view it as “a good servantand a bad master”. We should never let money control our lives and haunt our dreams.

79Why I Had to Leave My Job
1During my third week as Personal Secretary to James–an attractive, married 40-
something–he told me about his affair. This happened after his wife Sally came to the office whilehe was in a “ not-to be-disturbed meeting "" with Lucy, one of the company’s financial team.
2Naturally, I’d told his wife that he was busy, but as soon as “the meeting” was over, he called
me into his office. He told me he needed my cooperation to keep his affair secret. I was shocked.He seemed anxious to know whether I could keep it a secret, so I assured him that he could trustme.  He said I’d get a 15% pay rise immediately. I felt even more embarrassed. It was clear I wasbeing paid not only to keep his affair secret, but also to lie for him .
3The next day he bought a mobile phone for “emergency” use. Only he and I had the number
and he said I was only to call him on it if his wife or mistress became too suspicious. I was becomingpart of his messy private life. Yet I couldn’t afford to say no to the new salary. Could I?
4As time went by however, the lies began really to affect me. I felt sorry for both the wife and
the mistress. I wouldn’t want to be in their situation after all. As for James, he started to lookincreasingly worried and upset. He wanted to save his marriage and end the affair with Lucy. Whenhe asked me to help close his affair with Lucy, I almost refused. But he talked me round and
promised another pay rise. From then on, whenever Lucy phoned I lied to her and found excusesnot to put her call through. She got increasingly upset and aggressive on the phone, and I felt sickevery time I lied to her.
5One day, Lucy rushed into the office while James was at lunch with his wife. She demanded
I tell her where he was, so I said he was out with a client. I was humiliated when she accused me,in front of the whole office, of lying for him and getting money for that. “This was the last time” I saidto myself. “He had to do his own dirty work from now on.”The next day, I resigned and decided to find a new job with no lies and no deceit. You would do thesame, wouldn’t you?

Humour is the quality of being amusing, to appreciate things,
situations or people that are comic. Often, humour can be very difficult to understand. It sometimes means that in order

applications.
Example : 7 days without water make one weak (= week)
JOKE : Something said or done to provoke laughter. It is the humorous or ridiculous element in
something.
Example : Client: Waiter! Waiter! There is a fly in my soup.
Waiter: Don’t worry, it can swim.
IRONY : The humorous or sardonic use of words to express the opposite of what one really means (as
when words of praise are given and blame is in reality intended.)
Example : calling a fat person”tiny”or when someone makes a stupid mistake and you say 
to him “that was intelligent”.
SATIRE : A literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn.
Example : Molière’s plays; Aljahidh’s “Albukhala”.

Dear  Charles 
How can we try to persuade you to pay your long overdue account? We have tried many
suggestions for extending the payment period, for making the monthly payments smaller, forgetting help from lenders, and for at least discussing this matter with us. 
Now we have exhausted our own resources. We have to seek help from outside our own
company. We have consulted with our attorney and he told us that we have several solutionsavailable to us for collecting our money. 
We are very uncomfortable with the thought of going to court and, therefore, have decided to
extend your credit for fifteen more days.
To avoid legal action, we must have your check for £15.000 on or before February 19, 2005.
Sincerely,

a-former slave.

c- slave trader.  
a-a biography.
B.The text is taken from b- a school book.  
c- an autobiography.  
I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate
knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger partof the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masterswithin my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I was not allowed to make any inquiries ofmy master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper andimpertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit.
My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsy Bailey, both
colored, and quite dark. My father was a white man. The opinion was whispered that my masterwas my father. My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant, before I knew her as mymother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children fromtheir mothers at a very early age.
I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each
of these times was very short in duration, and at night. She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who livedabout twelve miles from my home. She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling thewhole distance on foot, after the performance of her day’s work. She was a field hand, and awhipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise.
I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She was with me in the night.
She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I woke up she was gone. Verylittle communication ever took place between us. Death soon ended what little we could have whileshe lived, and with it her hardships and suffering. She died when I was about seven years old, onone of my master’s farms, near Lee’s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at herdeath, or burial. She was gone long before I knew anything about it. Never having enjoyed, to anyconsiderable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care. I received the tidings ofher death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.

Answer the questions below with reference to the title and the picture.
•Who are the people?
•Where are they?
•What are they wearing?
•Do you dress in the same way at your school?
•Would you like to wear school uniforms?
Read the introduction and the beginning of each passage and say whether they
are : 
- descriptive- argumentative
or - expository
School uniforms are still fairly common in Britain. In fact they have even become more common
in recent years, as some schools have reintroduced them. Here some students at a girls-only highschool in the middle of England are giving their opinion about that issue. 
Stage Two : 
Rachel: Well I think they’re a good idea, because you
don’t have to decide what to wear in the morning. Youjust get up and put your uniform on. You don’t have tothink “Oh no, what am I going to wear today?” So Ithink they’re a good idea. There’s no competitioneither between the girls and whatever!Anita: Itdistinguishes you from
other schools. It makes you look likea community. I think it looks really
smart as well, and then we get a lot
of people saying how nice we look.1
Read the texts and tick where appropriate.
Match words in column “A” with the words closest in meaning in column “B”.
NB: There’s one extra item in “B”.
101Sue : You don’t necessarily lose your own
individuality by wearing a uniform; there’s
still something special about yourself as aperson. Just because you’re wearing thesame things, it doesn’t make you all thesame; it doesn’t matter what anyone elsethinks. Don’t worry about things like that. 
Katie : I think that by putting us all in the
same uniform, they suppress our identities;
and they’re saying like “oh we all have to lookthe same; we all have to think the same.”That’s how it seems to me.  
Sarah : I think, um… I came from primary school, and we didn’t
have to wear a uniform there; and coming to secondary school andwearing a uniform, I don’t know, I really enjoyed it; I used to beproud of it, of wearing it. But I think, yeah, there are faults in it, butI think there are the advantages as well.

Pushy Parents are here to stay
1Every autumn, as students start the business of selecting a university, stories appear in the
media about pushy parents who insist on expressing views about where their offspring should go.
2For the last two decades there has been a
growing involvement of parents in all stages in achild’s education. I have stood in queues inschools and heard parents telling their offspringwhat they should and shouldn’t take for GCSE. Asample of quotes overheard recently include: “NotFrench, that’s a waste of time"";"" music is to bedropped"";""let’s get over to the economics teacher”;and,"" I’ve told you, you’re not taking any uselesssubject like Latin.” Teachers confirm that parentsplay a huge role in determining what their childrenwill study, and that continues at A-level. By thetime they are selecting a university, Mum and Dad(more often Mum, apparently) are major players.
3Increased parental involvement is part of a shift in British culture that has seen the nature of
parenting change. Battles to get children into good nurseries are a fact of life, as is the decision ofmany parents to select a primary school as soon as a child is born. Today more and more childrengrow up continuously shepherded about by adults, unable to walk the streets alone or to disappearout to play.

A mother at work
I had no choice
1Patricia Vaz, 48, was the 1994 Businesswoman of the year. As
director of British Telecoms pay phones division, she was responsible forturning a deficit into a healthy profit. She lives in Herne Bay, Kent, withhusband Ronald, 52, a BT engineer. They have one son, Donavan, 28,a senior assistant manager with the corporate banking services divisionof the Nat West.
2Patricia says: “I went back to work when Donovan was two. It was
unusual in those days and people in the office made me feel guilty by saying, ‘How could you’, butI had no choice. We needed the money.
3For five years I worked for the printing Federation, ending up in charge of administration. I
joined BT as a clerical officer in 1975, when Donovan was eight. I later moved into planning andthen management. I felt terrible about not being there when Donovan got home from school.
4“I had to drop him at the childminder’s house at 7 a.m, on my way to catch the train to work.
Luckily, he was very fond of her and called her ‘Auntie Margaret.’ She looked after him until it wastime to go to school. She also picked him up and stayed with him until I got home in the evening.Although I was relieved that their relation was a good one, I felt she was having precious hours withhim which should have been mine .

1I teach children music. Nothing strange about that, you might think. Except that I’m deaf.
I was born partially deaf and I wear a hearing aid in each ear, but even when I was a little girl I lovedplaying the piano and triangle. My mum got so fed up with the noise that she booked me in for piano
lessons.
2Right from the start I was hooked , even though it was sometimes hard for me to get the right
pitch . But I learnt never to use my deafness as an excuse. I’d spend hours practising to get the
tunes right and when I was 11, I won a scholarship to music school.
3Since then, I’ve never looked back. I play the French horn, violin, piano and trumpet and
passed exams and diplomas so that I can teach too.
4I used to work with drama and dance companies, but when I was 30 I helped a friend
organise a concert for children. It was so much fun and so rewarding that I decided to work withchildren. I set up my own company. The Music House for Children and taught piano lessons.
5Now I’m 36, I employ 30 music teachers and we teach nearly 300 children all over London.
I also work with deaf children at a special school. It makes it all worthwhile when I see these
children light up . It reminds me how far I’ve come from that little deaf girl who used to bang the
piano so tunelessly.

Dear Sir,
I was surprised to read your recent editorial on the
question of students’ part-time jobs. You appear to bemaking a lot of generalisations on the basis of just oneunfortunate incident (I assure you that not all youngpeople who deliver newspapers are as foolish anddishonest as the two youths mentioned in your article).
The first point I would like to make is that there are
many jobs teenagers can do which give them usefulexperience of the working world. They are brought intocontact with a variety of people, often older, and aregiven experience of expressing themselves clearly andcoherently. I am thinking here of jobs such as travelguides and shop assistants.
Another argument for schoolchildren and college students having holiday or weekend jobs is
that many parents need the financial assistance. If we take, for example, a family in which the fatheris unemployed or perhaps a single-parent family on a low income, it seems logical and fair that ason or daughter should try to bring money into the household.
One further thing I want to say is that a lot of jobs for the young can be fun for the people who
do them and also useful to the community. Youngsters who help in schools, hospitals and with theelderly often derive a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction as well as contributing somethingvaluable to local society.
In conclusion, I would add that when I was a girl, my father said my teens were a time for books,
hobbies and academic studies. Thinking back, I feel I would have learnt much more-about myself,other people and life in general-if he had allowed me to do a limited amount of real work. Certainly,when she is old enough, I shall encourage my own daughter to do so, rather than waste her timewith soap operas, computer games and discotheques, like so many young people today.
Yours faithfully,

The importance of libraries
1Librarians, and the people who support libraries make use of the library's wonders. They are,
according to me, the heroes of civilization. These people, in their quiet way, have maintained one ofcivilization's great traditions: the gathering of the human life experience. In this way, libraries havebeen and shall always be the engines of civilization's progress.Stage One : LESSON 23

2In fact, without libraries, such progress would be impossible, especially in our modern era.
These days, we all depend upon libraries. We can explore the thoughts and actions of others. Andthat gives us a remarkable power to change and grow and do things better.
3Good films or television programs have their place, but when you really need to understand
a question in depth, you've got to turn to books. And because books are so expensive these days,libraries have become very important to ensure that reading doesn't become a hobby for the rich.
4Books are the lifeblood of the library because they enlighten our world, and encourage the
expansion of culture. With these words in mind, I think we owe it to ourselves and to futuregenerations to serve others by keeping learning and literacy alive. The future of the countryabsolutely depends on a literate population, and reaching that goal involves strong supportof our public schools, universities, and public libraries.
5If I could give young people a valuable gift, it would be a good education, an education rich
in literature, science, mathematics, history, crafts, sport, and the fine arts. It would be an educationwith no shortage of excellent teachers and a full supply of the world's best books. I do stronglybelieve that “the more you read, the more you know.  The more you know, the smarter you grow….”So, let’s pay tribute to our teachers and take good care of our libraries.

Death of the Single
1No one doubts that they once were the passion of teenagers, the first thing they spent their
pocket money or tiny pay packets on. Everyone wanted the latest single, and programmes such asTop of the Pops succeeded on them .But not any more . The single may have had its day, killed off
by the internet, MTV and mobile phones.
2In the UK music sales have been falling down steadily, and singles in particular are badly hit.
In the third week of January 2002, just 400.000 singles were bought across the UK, the worstperformance in 35 years and just half of those sold in the same week four years ago. A mere 10singles managed to sell more than 10.000 copies, compared to three times that amount five yearsearlier.
3In the same year, 2002, in the USA music sales overall plunged by nearly 9 percent. The only
exception was Eminem the Detroit-based rapper-turned-actor, who has plenty to celebrate. Eminemwas the only artist in 2002 to surpass the 5 million mark. Industry wide, total sales fell 8.7 percentfrom 2001 to nearly 650 million units the second year-to-year decline in a row.
4Dr. Fox, who hosts the Hit 40 UK chart show on Sunday nights, says: “When I was a kid all
we had was Top of the Pops and Radio One. There was nowhere else to go to for the latest songs.
So, if you loved something , you had to buy it .You couldn’t get it anywhere else, but now there are
so many places you can hear your favourite music. Twenty years ago you didn’t have 10 differentmusic channels or 300 radio stations playing pop music.” And he also blamed the endless supply ofcompilation albums. He says: “The record companies have only themselves to blame. Just aboutevery single released will be on compilation album the same week. “Would you want to spend threepounds on one song or get 40 track for a few more?” With CD albums costing as little as £8.50compared to £3 to £5 for singles, it is not surprising people are shunning singles.  Another nail inthe single’s coffin is the speed at which artists release a new album after their single hits the chart.

5In the last decade the pop music world has become highly competitive, and the drop in
singles sales is the first casualty of a bitter battle for supremacy. Today there are so many moreways of getting hold of a song than just buying the single or the album. Pop fans can downloadtracks from the internet, buy them as ring tone for their mobile phone, or record them from MTV.Another cause of the slump in the overall sales  is that radio stations now play songs for up to twomonths before they are released  , boring potential customers to death before the single or thealbum is even in the shops.

How to write a limerick
A limerick is a funny little poem containing five lines. The last words of the first, second and fifth
lines rhyme with each other (A), and the last words of the third and fourth lines rhyme with eachother (B). Here’s an example:
There was an old man from Peru,  (A)              
Who dreamed he was eating his shoe (A)                           He woke in the night    (B)               With a terrible fright     (B)And found out that it was quite true.(A)

At the end of each day, some people like to sit and write down the things that happened during
that day. Sometimes they describe events, and sometimes they include their own feelings aboutthose events.
Very often, these people write in a special book called a diary. Each time they write, the section
of the diary that they write is called an entry. An entry usually begins with the time of writing:Thursday, March 17 or Thursday evening or Thursday, March 17, 8:00p.m.
You are going to write an entry in a diary.
Activity 1 : Writing about past events.
a-Think of a particular day you would like to describe. Try to remember the
events of that day. Then write about the day and the things that happened. Beginyour diary entry with the day and date on which you are writing. Follow theexample below, but use your own day and date, and of course your own events.
Tuesday, Nov.10- Yesterday was a wonderful day for me. I got a nice long letter from my
Swedish pen friend. I felt very happy when I ……………
b-Now write a diary entry of your own. It does not have to be a long one. Here
are some questions that may help you decide what to write.
How did the day begin?
What was the first thing that happened that day?How did you feel at the beginning of the day?Did any thing important happen that day? Interesting? Amusing? Good? Bad? Were there any surprises for you that day?All in all, was it a good day? A bad day? An ordinary day?
Sometimes a diary entry is in the past tense, sometimes in the present, and sometimes in the
future. When the entry is in the present tense, it is usually because the person is describing how heor she feels at the moment and what he or she is thinking about. Very often such an entry includesopinions or beliefs about certain things.
How do we express our opinions? We use verbs like think, believe, and feel. We begin with
phrases like in my opinion, if you ask me, as far as I’m concerned or it seems to me that. And weuse auxiliaries like should and modifiers like too (too much, too many) and enough (enough, notenough).
Activity 2 : Writing about personal opinions.
In this activity there is a list of five topics. After each topic, write some opinion about that topic
using one of the words and phrases from the list below. If you have no opinion about a particulartopic, state the opinion of another person or other people (My friend believes……or In the opinionof some people………).

In activity 1, you wrote about past events; in activity 2, you wrote about present opinions. Now
you’re going to write about hopes and dreams for the future. Perhaps there are some things thatyou want and some things that you don’t want. There are different ways to describe those things.
a-Study the following examples :
I want to be fluent in English. (expresses ambition)
I would like to be fluent in English. (expresses desire)I wish I were fluent in English. (expresses desire but it is not the situation now)
b-Now use the following hints to produce similar sentence patterns.
134A famous footballer   / a teacher of English / a pop singer / a heart surgeon / a ballet dancer.
Activity 3 : Writing about hopes and dreams.
Answer the following questions.
•Where do you want to be next summer? (Begin with next summer.)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
•What country would you like to visit someday? (Begin with I and finish with some day).
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
•What is the one thing that you wish you had? (Begin with I wish.)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
•What is the one thing that you hope it will happen in the future? (Be sure to use hope and the
present tense.)__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Once you finish these three activities you will be able to start your own diary.

138Stage One : LESSON 25
Pre-ReadingInternet Addiction
How to survive the internet? Some people just can’t stop clicking.
Internet addicts “need help”.         The escape key could
provide a way out.      
“Internet addiction is a growing problem and doctors should be
better equipped to deal with it”, a research from the Centrefor Online Addiction suggests.
Self test reveals all :
Answer the following questions with ‘yes’ or ‘no ’.
•Do you feel preoccupied with the Internet (you think about your previous online activity or 
anticipate your next session)? 
•Do you feel the need to use the Internet with increasing amounts of time in order to achieve
satisfaction? 
•Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use? 
•Do you stay online longer than originally intended? 
•Have you risked the loss of a significant relation, job, educational or career opportunity 
because of the Internet? 
•Have you lied to family members, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with the 
Internet? 
•Do you use the Internet as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving, for example, 
feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety or depression? 
Interpretation :
If you answered ‘yes ‘to at least five of the questions above, you are an addict.
Join a group to read one of the following passages. After reading, each group
answers the following :

Yes, I use the internet, but I can happily live without it. I just wish this was the case with my wife.
When she gets in from work, the PC goes on and it can be 5 or more hours before she logs off.At the same time the mobile phone is constantly going as she talks to people she's having anonline conversation with. It's not uncommon for her to be talking to one person about threedifferent things in three different chat rooms. Our marriage is suffering as a result, as is herrelationship with her son. But how do you get someone to acknowledge it as a problem? If Imention it to my wife, she becomes very aggressive and defensive, so how can I help her?

Hmmm, sitting in front of a computer screen for seven hours a night. A lot of people sit in front
of their TVs for similar amounts of time. Is this not just as bad (if not worse - there's absolutely nointeractivity)? I don't have a TV and experienced similar feelings of 'wow’!  Personally I think it isfar healthier to be surfing the internet for hours than mindlessly drooling in front of the one-eyedgod.

I am one of those who met her fiancé through cyberspace. However, soon after we met up in
person, my excessive love of the internet cost me engagement. We loved each other very much, except the problem of chatting on the internet. He asked me tostop chatting on the Internet because he was jealous and the jealousy developed into lack ofconfidence. He made it clear later that I have to stop chatting with other men. I couldn't stop. Ineed to feel closer to the rest of the world, so we broke up.

a-look                   b-live                  c-feel
•The reason for believing that future man will be different is that he:
a-never stops changing       b-never stops growing     c-has recently begun to change
•People’s heads will eventually grow larger. This is because their brains will:
a-grow faster     b-be in constant use        c-work less

1Business owners choose to sell for a variety of reasons:
• Retirement.
• Partnership dispute.• Diminished interest in the business due to boredom or frustration.• Illness or death of one of the principals.• Sales and earnings have stagnated because the company lacks the working capital or 
management resources to grow.
• Losing money.
Selling a business is different from selling any other asset one owns, because a business is
more than an income earning asset. It is a lifestyle as well. Therefore, the decision to sell it can bedifficult. Personal ambitions should be weighed against economic consequences to make a properlybalanced decision to sell or not to sell.
2It is said that timing is everything, and certainly that old saying is true when we  sell a
business. Intelligent business owners carefully plan out the decision to sell. They recognize that abusiness should be sold only after proper preparation and not because of sudden personalproblems  or a short-term crisis in business.
3For a wise business owner that proper preparation means the business should be clean, the
inventory current, and the equipment in good working order. Moreover, a valuation report and abusiness presentation package should be prepared. The valuation report eliminates guesswork andgives the exact value of the asset. The presentation package should cover all the facets of thebusiness. They include:
• A history of the business.
• A description of how the business operates.• A description of the facilities.• A discussion of suppliers.• A review of marketing practices.• A description of the competition.• A review of personnel including an organizational chart, description of job responsibilities, 
rates of pay, and willingness of key employees to stay on after the sale.
Answer the following questions.
a-Why is selling a business different from selling other possessions? (par. 1)
b-What must intelligent business owners avoid when selling an asset? (par.2)
c-Why is a valuation report necessary? (par.3)LESSON E10 Selling  a business

If we don’t control the CFCs damage to the ozone layer, it could increase the amount
of solar ultraviolet light that reaches the earth’s surface. That would be very dangerous
as it would, among other things, damage crops and cause cancer in humans. 
Global warming is a fact today. Global average temperatures have risen about 1°c 
in the past century and will probably continue to rise, jumping as much as 5°c overthe next century. That means sea levels will be high enough to cover coastal areas
and river deltas and endanger more than 100 million people.
148

Tropical rain forests are the site of great damage. Although they cover only 6% of
the land surface, they contain more than half the species of plants and animals ofthe entire world. The rate of clearing and burning of rain forests is too high to 
be ignored . Every year 0.25% or more of the forest species are becoming extinct.

Stage Two : 
ReadingWater Scarcity
Water is life
1
A-Population growth is the main cause. The rise of human numbers to more than six billion in
the year 2000 meant that water consumption almost doubled in half a century. Demand ofcourse comes 
not only from the need to drink, the need to wash, and the need to deal with
human waste, but also from industry in the developed world and from agriculture in the
developing world.
B-Mankind’s most serious challenge in the 21st century might not be war or hunger or disease,
a UN report says; it may be the lack of fresh water. Although water is the commonest thing on Earth, only 2.5 percent of it is fresh, while the rest is salt. What is available, in lakes, rivers,aquifers, (ground water) and rainfall run-off, is now increasingly coming under pressure fromseveral directions.

Read  paragraph B and find an expression that explains the title“water scarcity.”
LANGUAGE PRACTICE
a-Focus on the underlined parts in the following sentence and guess the
relation between part 1 and part 2. Do you think the relation shows: 
a-addition?
b-opposition?
or c-result?

Demand comes not only from the need to drink, the need to wash, and the need 
2
to deal with human waste but also from industry in the developed world and 
from agriculture in the developing world.                                        
b- Express differently using “not only… but also.”(Number 1 has been done for
you.)
•It’s cold and wet in the North:  It’s not only cold but also wet in the North.
•He’s deaf and dumb.
•Both his father and his mother are dead.
•Both Peter and John are pop fans.
•They both smoke and drink.
•He can speak both English and German.
•She can play the guitar and the drum.
•He has the time and the money to play polo.
•He dislikes the way we speak and disapproves of the way we dress.
•They broke into his office, stole his books and tore up his manuscripts.
153C-Irrigation has played a major role historically in poverty alleviation by providing food security,
protection against famine, and expanded opportunities for employment both on and off the farm.Development of irrigated agriculture has been a major engine for economic growth and povertyreduction.
D-All that’s bad enough. But what’s increasing the stress on water supply still further is climate
change which will probably account for a fifth of the increase in water scarcity. Because of globalwarming, rainfall is predicted to decrease 
not only in drought-prone countries, but also in
tropical regions.

This is an extract from a play about the environment. Read it and do the
activities.
Save The Lofty Trees
(An environmental Play)
(Whole class on stage, sitting. First three children step up.)
Child 1:           Here’s a story about the Lofty Tree,
and how one day it ceased to be.
Child 2:           We would all like to know
how we should let things live and grow.
Child 3:           So listen to how once upon a day,
we could let our land fall into disarray.
(Whole group sings)
Save the lovely Lofty Trees.
Lofty Trees, Lofty Trees.Save the lovely Lofty Trees.Save them if you please. 
(Two more children step up.)Child 4:             The lofty trees are a sight to see,
they give shade and beauty to you and me.Birds and squirrels make their homes and hide,rabbits and deer live together side by side.
Child 5:             The lofty tree has flowers so sweet,
for the bees they are quite a treat.
To rest beneath the lofty tree,
Oh what a joy that’s to me! 
(Enter factory owner and woodcutter.)Factory owner:   Ha! Ha! Ha! I found you, Lofty trees,
Now I’ll build my factories.I’ll make my money in great big piles,cut down Lofties for miles and miles.
Woodcutter:         Come on, let’s chop those Lofties down.
Build a store, build a town.Chop, Chop, Chop,
T I M B E R!
156Stage Two : 
Reading Comprehension

(Enter conservationist.)
Conservationist:   STOP! STOP! Don’t you care or understand
what would happen to the animals and to our land?I’ll speak for our planet till my face turns blue.Don’t you realize what all this chopping is leading to?STOP!  STOP!  STOP! ... STOP! 
Factory owner:    No! I won’t. I want my fame.
I want everyone to know my name.I’ll use the Lofties in every way.Bring them to me every day.
Conservationist:   Stop! Stop! Doesn’t anyone care?
Stop! Soon there will be no more Lofties anywhere.
This destruction has to end.
Won’t anyone join me and be my friend?
Child 1:               The animals and plants are in big trouble.
They have to leave on the double.
By chopping the Lofties to the ground,
There isn’t enough food to go around.
Child 2:                And the factories, they have too much smoke.
They blacken the sky and make us choke.
All the children:    How we’ll miss our Lofty Trees.
How we’ll miss the gentle breeze.
Trees help us, as we all know. 
We are the children who love you so.Oh Lofty Trees, Please don’t go!
Factory owner:     Oh children, I hate your story.
My Lofties will bring me fame and glory Search for Lofties far and wide.Search and scour the countryside.I’ll make my money in great big piles;Cut down Lofties for miles and miles.
All the children:     Not a lofty inside; how grim, how sad.
Not a Lofty flower or nut to be had.
Animals have fled; they’ve gone away.And we’ve lost a place to play;
Mr Factory Owner, what did you do?Mr Factory Owner, how mean of you!
157
Factory Owner:     I’m sorry for my acts of greed.
I didn’t think of our earth’s need.Now there’s ugliness mile after mile.
And it’s all because of my meanie style.
Oh dear! Oh dear! What can I do?Oh dear! Oh dear! My life is through.I’m sorry for the nasty things I did.
All children:           Oh, don’t be sad. Look! We see a happy kid.Happy kid:            I have some lovely trees to plant.
We’ll start a new forest, don’t say you can’t.It’s not too late to help and share.It’s not too late to show you care.
Whole group:        The Earth is our home. Be very kind.
Protect things in nature. Keep that in your mind.Let’s not be careless and make our land look bad.Our home, the Earth, is a place for us to feel glad.

through interactive television. Early online courses using electronic mail (had rapidly followed -
were rapidly followed - were rapidly following) by web-based instruction. Today, the lines are
blurred between different types of distance learning courses as multiple modes of delivery areemployed in a single course. For example, a class ""library"" could be a website; class discussionscould take place (using - used - usage) electronic mail; some course content could be delivered
using printed materials and television; and the final activity could be a place-bound proctored exam.

Grammar summary
Want and would like are used to express a desire.
Would like can be used instead of the present tense of the verb want and is a more polite form.
Instead of I want to see Mr. Pitt.         We can say  I would like to see Mr. Pitt.
These two verbs can be followed by infinitives, not clauses.
I would like to go to Oxford.
She wants to give support to her relatives.
They can be followed by a Noun Phrase (N P) and a full infinitive.
She would like her daughter to become a doctor.
He wants his friend to visit him again.
1- Form
The present perfect is formed with the present tense of to have + the past participle of the verb .
I have worked .
2- Use
The present perfect can be used with :a-a time expression to indicate that the action began in the past and continues in the present.
He has been in the army fortwo years. (he is still in the army).
I have smoked since I left school. (I still smoke).
166Lesson one :

The cause / result relationship is expressed with words like:
because, as, so, since, so…..that, such….that – which join two sentences.
Examples: 
He felt cold. He built a fire.He felt cold so he built a fire.He built a fire because he felt cold.
The first sentence is the cause of building fire.
The second sentence is the result of feeling cold.
– We camped there because it was too dark to go on
.
– As we hadn’t any money , we couldn’t buy anything to eat.
– Since you are unable to answer perhaps we should ask someone else.
The underlined clauses show the cause.
His speech went on for so long that people began to fall asleep .
They had such a fierce dog that no one dared to go near their house .
The underlined clauses show the result.
The word either is frequently added at the end of a  two-clause  sentence.
I haven’t seen the movie, and my friend hasn’t, either.
Do Mary and Margaret both want bananas? Mary doesn’t want any, and Margaret doesn’t, either .
The same construction can be used in the affirmative with as well or too.
I went and she went, as well .

All English nouns can be divided into two classes: those that are countable and those that are
uncountable.
A countable noun is, by definition, one that can be preceded by one (or a or an), two, three, etc.
An uncountable noun is one that can not be preceded by  a cardinal number.
The comparative shows differences  (contrasts) between two things or groups. The superlative
shows differences in three or more things or groups.
169Lesson nine : 
Countable / uncountable nouns
Lesson ten : 
The comparative /superlativeCountable nouns Uncountable nouns
- Have singular and plural forms. - Have only one form.
- Take singular and plural verbs. - Take only singular verbs.
- Have a, anor onebefore them as

- Can have number of before them
only in the plural.- Can have amount of before them.
1-With one-syllable adjectives, add erfor the comparative and estfor the superlative.
John is younger than Paul.
John is the youngest boy in our class.
2-For adjectives of more than two syllables we make the comparative form with more and the
superlative form with most . 
Industrious            more industrious       the most industrious
Two –syllable adjectives ending in –fulor reusually take more and most.
doubtful                 more doubtful           the most doubtful 
mature                   more mature              the most mature
Two syllable adjectives ending in -er or –yusually add erand est.

• A purpose is normally expressed by an infinitive:
a-By a simple infinitive.
Ex. He went to Japan to learn Japanese.
When there is a personal object of the main verb, the infinitive will refer to this and not to the subject.
Ex. He sent his son to Japan to study Japanese . (the son was to study).
b-By in order with the infinitive.
Ex. She is studying foreign languages in order to qualify for the school of tourism.
c-By clauses of purpose. Clauses are necessary when the person to whom the purpose refers is
mentioned, instead of being merely understood.
Ex. Ships carry lifeboats so that the crew can escape if the ship goes on fire. (the purpose refers to
the crew.)
• Purpose clauses are usually expressed by:
So that + will/would or can/could + infinitive
Ex. They wrote the notices in several languages so that foreign tourists could understand them.
Can and will are used when the main verb is in a present,present perfect or future tense; could and
would are used when the main verb is in a past tense.
Ex. I am lighting the fire so that the house will be warm when they come back.
I pinned the note to his pillow so that he would be sure to see it.
173Lesson twenty one 
Expressing Purpose

b-A past routine not necessarily discontinued.
Ex.It was very hot in the middle of the day and most people used to spend the early afternoon in bed.
(They did this when we were there; very likely they still do).
•With the interrogative and negative forms used to can be conjugated as an auxiliary or as an 
ordinary verb (with did). But only the second form is used in spoken English.
Ex. Did he use to go on foot?
He didn’t use to stay after school.       He never used to stay after school.
•Not to confuse with the construction ‘to be used to’ which can be used in all tenses followed by
a noun or a gerund.
Ex. I’m not used to this wet weather .
Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.
I’m not used to working in such hard conditions. I used to work in a five-star hotel.
•Parallel Change is expressed by :

The more leisure she has, the happier she is.The better they knew him, the more deceived they become.
•Sometimes to be and the subject are omitted
Ex. The more, the merrier.

Parallel Change
•Some and Any mean ‘a certain quantity/number’ , and are used before plural or uncountable 
nouns. They can be pronouns or adjectives.
Some is used in affirmative sentences.
Ex. I can lend you some books.
Any is used:
a-In negative sentences.
Ex. I haven’t any children and she hasn’t either.
b-After hardly, barely, and scarcely (which are almost negative).
Ex. I have hardly any cash left.
c-After interrogatives.
Ex. Have you got any photos of the party?
Did you see any of the new collections?
•But when the question is really an invitation or a request some is used.
Ex. Will you have some tea?
Will you carry some of these books for me, please?
Some can also be used when the answer ‘yes’ is expected.
Ex. I heard a knock; is there someone at the door?
d-After if and in expressions of doubt.
Ex. If I find any of your letters I’ll send them to you.
I doubt whether there is any milk left in the fridge.
e-To mean’ practically every’.
Ex. Anybody will show you the way (everyone knows it).
•Noand none can be used with affirmative verbs to express a negative. They are often an
alternative to the negative verb+ any construction. Any can be a pronoun or an adjective, while
nois only an adjective and none is always a pronoun.
Ex. I haven’t any apples and he hasn’t any.
I have no apples and he has none.
I did not find any tickets left and he did not find any.
I found no tickets left and he found none.
• Compounds formed with some , any, and nofollow the same rules mentioned above.
Someone   somebody  something   Ex.  I know something
Anyone     anybody    anything      Ex.  Do you know anything?
No one      nobody      nothing       Ex. You do not know anything/you know nothing.
175Lesson twenty four 
Some / Any
(past tense/present tense/changing pronouns)
When we turn direct speech into indirect or reported speech some changes are necessary whether we
are dealing with statements, questions, or commands. However, when the introductory verb (say, tellremark………..) is in the present, present perfect or future, direct statements can be reported withoutany changes of tense.
Ex. He says, ‘The train will be late.’
He says the train will be late. (no changes for the tense.)
But when the introductory verb is in the past tense, which it usually is, the following tense changes are
necessary:
He said, ‘Ann willbe in Paris on Monday.’ He said that Ann would be in Paris on Monday.      
He said, ‘I’ ll be using the car myself.’ He said that he would be using the car himself.
‘I never eatmeat’, he explained.       He explained that he never atemeat.
• In written English past tenses usually do change to past perfect but there are the following
exceptions :
a-Past/past continuous tenses used in time clauses do not normally change :
Ex. He said, ‘ When we were living/lived in Paris………….’
He said that when they were living/lived in Paris……… .
The main verb of such sentences can either remain unchanged or become the past perfect.
Ex. He said, ‘ When we were living/lived in Paris we often saw Paul.’
He said that when they were living/lived in Paris they often saw Paul/had often seen Paul.
b-A past tense used to describe a state of affairs which still exists when the speech is reported remains
unchanged.
Ex.She said, ‘I decided not to buy the house because it was on a main road.’
She said that she had decided not to buy the house because it was on a main road.
c-Would,should,ought,had better,might,used to,could and must do not normally change:
Ex. He said, ‘I might be there.’_______ He said that he might be there.
She said, ‘I would help him If I could.’______She said that she would help him if she could.
176Lesson twenty five 
The reported speech
Direct Speech Reported Speech
future conditional
future continuous conditional continuous
simple present simple past
present continuous past continuous
present perfect past perfect
present perfect continuous past perfect continuous
d-Conditional sentences type 2 and past tenses (subjunctives) used after wish, would, rather, it is
time remain entirely unchanged :
Ex. He said,’ If my children were older I would emigrate.’______He said that if his children  were 
older he would emigrate.He said,’ I wish  I knew.’_________  He said that he wished he knew.She said,’I’d rather Tom went.’________ She said that she’d rather Tom went.
• Other changes necessary when turning direct speech into reported speech:
a-In reported speech the conjunction that can be placed immediately after the introductory verb, but
it is not essential and is often omitted:
Ex. He said,’ I have seen a ghost.’
He said (that) he had seen a ghost.
b-Pronouns and possessive adjectives normally change from first or second person to third
person except when the speaker is reporting his own words:
Ex. I said,’ I like my new house.’
I said that I liked my new house (reporting one’s own words.)He said,’ I’ve forgotten the combination to mysafe.’
He said that hehad forgotten the combination of hissafe.
‘You’ve overcooked the steak again, Mary,’ he said.
He told Mary that shehad overcooked the steak again.
c-This and These .
This used in time expressions usually becomes that:
Ex. He said,’ She is coming thisweek.’
He said that she was coming that week.
This and that when used as adjectives usually change to the:
Ex. He said,’ I bought thispearl/ these pearls for my mother.’
He said that he had bought thepearl(s) for his mother.
(more and more  / less and less).
Gradual Increase is expressed by 2 comparatives joined by “and.
Ex. The weather is getting colder and colder.
He became more and more self-confident
(almost, nearly, quite, just, too ……..)
177Lesson twenty six 
Gradual Increase /decrease
Lesson twenty seven 
Adverbs of degree 
a-An adverb of degree modifies an adjective or another adverb. It is placed before the adjective or
adverb.
Ex. It was toohot to work..
The film was fairly good.
I know him quite well.
He played extremely badly.
b-The infinitive after too, enough .
• Too + adjective + infinitive
Ex. You are too young to understand .(You do not understand because you are too young).
It was too late to do anything. (He could not do anything because it was too late).
• Adjective + enough + infinitive
Ex. You are old enough to know better. (You should know better at your age).
He was intelligent enough to turn off the gas. (He turned off the gas).
Not only ........... but also are pairs of conjunctions that are used together to join the members of  a
parallel structure.
The first part of the correlative expression comes before the first member and the second part before
the second member.
1 1                             2 2
Ex. Henry not only returned the money but also paid interest.
1 1             2 2
Not only the parents but also the children enjoyed the program.
1 1         2 2
She was born not only deaf but also dumb .
NB : Correlative conjunction must be followed by the same grammatical structure.

e","Perform to learnPerform to learn Second Year Secondary Education Student’s Book Authors : Ezzeddine AMMAR M’hammed MERDESSI Inspector Inspector Ali OMRANE MedHabib RADDAOUI Advisor Senior teacher Evaluators : Jaouida BEN AFIA Abdennour KHEMIRI General Inspector Inspector National Pedagogic CentreREPUBLIC OF TUNISIA MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Authors’ acknowledgements We are deeply grateful to all the people who helped us materialize this project. We are indebted in particular to the evaluation team Ms Jaouida Ben AFIA (General Inspector) and MrAbdennour KHEMIRI (Inspector). We’ve made use of so many sources that it would be impossible to name them all. The Forum Magazine,British and American dailies and magazines, andInternet sites are but some of these sources. No matter how hard we always tried to adapt and customize the material, we still hope we have notinfringed on anyone’ s rights. ©All rights reserved for National Pedagogic Centre 3Preface PERFORM TO LEARN is a book for the Second Year Secondary Education. It is based on the following key principles: The learner is considered as a manager of his/her own improvement, capable of taking the learning process as his/her own responsibility. She/he should therefore be encouraged todevelop autonomy and critical thinking. What the learner does and how she/he processesinformation during the lesson is to be the focal point of the teaching/learning process. The book is organised in themes to give the learner a chance to explore and recycle language through various activities . Furthermore, it enables him/her to smoothly transit from one lesson to the next without getting confused. Certain formats are repeated throughout the book in order to help the learner and give him/her the confidence that comes with familiarity. For a balanced learning, the four main skills are considered of equal importance and have been almost evenly spread throughout the book with a balanced weighting. The book consists of a preface, a book map, a diagnostic test, a review module, a series of 30 lessons, 10 supplementary lessons for Arts and 10 for Economics branches and anappendix. We do hope the practitioners and the learners will find the material relevant, useful and varied. More important though, we hope the material will be exploited so as to interest thelearner and lead him/her towards the ultimate goal: Learning how to learn.

A B CD E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S.................................... ............ ............ ............ .................................................................................................................................... ............ ........I often study English, at home, in a library…I learn English to pass my exam, to get a good job…I don’t like making mistakes when I speak English.I have to work hard to learn English because my parents feel it is necessary for myfuture.I love speaking English with other learners of the same level.I feel that attending English classes is enjoyable because I simply want to, not becauseI have to.I think my teachers should force me to speak more in class.I would love to go on a year-long world tour, even if I had a little money.If I don’t speak in class, it’s because the topic/task is not interesting. I watch English-language TV and films even though I understand nothing. I hate it when one person does all the talking in class.Quite often, I’m happy just to listen to the teacher.I often feel a little embarrassed when I talk in class.I think the teacher is what motivates a student most.I prefer learning grammar, vocabulary, etc to speaking activities.I wish I could go to an English class everyday instead of just twice or three times a week.Basically, I think that a speaking activity should be for practising the grammar I have justlearnt.I regularly ask the other students questions and comment on what they say in class.I am a girl.Questionnaire : Put True (T) or False (F) after each statement. (If you hesitate between T and F put both.) 14Interpretation : A, E, F, H, J, P, R =True.This basically indicates you are a self-motivated, hard-working learner. It also indicates your desire to socialise, to meet other races and cultures. This is what language is for. Theperfect student. A talker and a walker.B, D, G, I, K, N =True. You strongly feel you are obliged to learn, which is not self-motivation. Don’t worry, but remember that a good learner must want to achieve for himself and must not blame his/herpoor performance on others/external factors.C, O =True.This can mean that you are a perfectionist. You pay attention to formal details. This can be good, but it can also be an obstacle to communication. An anxious talker.G, I, K, L, N =True.This means you are not active enough. You are just an occasional talker. M = True. It happens to everybody at the beginning, but don’t worry you’ll feel better after a few classes. Q =True. This is a big issue. But how can you talk about the world with a few phrases? You may be a traditional learner. Remember, the ultimate aim of English is to communicate.S =True. Bingo! It is said that girls work harder at languages than boys. Some of the above statements may apply to several interpretations.

The Gifts My Father Gave MeRead the text, then answer the questions. Animal lovers value their pets. They would prefer the company of their pets to a human companion. Besides providing companionship, owning a pet has actually saved lives! Animals are thought to have strong feelings or intuition that humans don't. Some of the amazing examples of the strong feelings of animals are those where they have sensed a near future self-killing or suicide and saved human's life.

First, it is well (know - known - knowing) for the Wheaton River, which is very wide and beautiful.

Also, (at - on - in ) the other side of the town is Wheaton Hill , (who - which- whose) is unusual because it is very steep. Even though it is steep, climbing this hill is not dangerous because there are some firm rocks along the sides that can be used as stairs.There are no trees around this hill, so it stands clearly against the sky and can be (see - seen - saw) from many miles away.

It just happened when my Mr Right came along with a ready-madefamily. Jennifer Middledich was always the stepmother then,on Mother’s Day, Came herwell-deserved reward.The Day I Stopped Being a Stepmum (Part one) Suddenly, aged 20, I became stepmum to three children : Jay, nine, Dan, seven, and Kerry- the baby, aged five. At first, it was hard, to say the least. The childrenwould do anything to test my patience. I’ve never tried to be anything other than a stepmum. The kids have their own mum and I’ve always respected that. I was always ‘Jenny ‘. As time passed however, it was wonderful to be accepted intotheir lives. The older they grew, the fonder I grew of them, and the less I regretted never having children of my own. I loved them as if they were my own. When Kerry announced she was having a baby, Steve and I were really happy. Kerry was like the daughter I’d never had. So, when little Bradley arrived, I was knocked sideways by the outpouring of love I felt towards him. I’ve never been maternal but, holding him in my arms, I just melted. (Part two) On Mother’s Day last year , I was watching from the window, waiting for little Bradley, aged one to arrive. “ They’re here, they’re here,” I shrieked excitedly, as the car pulled up. Eagerly, I ran out of the front door, and made straight for the car’s rear door to get Bradley out of his baby seat. “Hello BJ,” I said, as Bradley grinned up at me. I always called him BJ_ short for BradleyJones. Clutched carefully in his little hand was a bunch of paper flowers. “Give her the flowers,” Kerry urged gently. He gave me the bouquet and sweetly said “Nan.”I stared at him, astonished and in tears, then I gently took him out of his chair and held him to me tightly.” I’m Bradley’s Nan, I’m Bradley’s Nan;” I kept repeating to myself with delight ” he’s just said so.”Then, holding my precious flowers carefully, I went back inside with my grandson. It was the happiest moment of my entire life. Since then I’ve become a grand-mother.

Hard to decide I have no intention to leave school in the near future because high qualifications are requested if you want to find an attractive job these days. I have often wondered however whether I shouldcontinue to live with my parents when I finish university, or whether I’d better leave home to be on my own . On the one hand, it would be terribly tempting to live by myself, rent my own flat, see whoever I want, and go out whenever I please. My parents wouldn’t know what I’m doing and so theywouldn’t be able to criticize this or that aspect of my lifestyle. By living alone I would also find outwhether I can really manage alone without always falling back on Mum and Dad for their financial help or their judicious advice. All in all, it would probably be the best way to see if I’m really an adultor not, but then I would have to become more level-headed and more organised than I am now ! On the other hand I may choose to stay at home when I leave school. I know that my parents wouldn’t mind in the least and I can actually see quite a few advantages to this situation. First of all,it would be safer than to move out and look for adventure. Besides, I’ve always felt at ease with my parents because they are rather open-minded for their age and because I know that I can count on them whenever I face a difficult situation. It seems only logical then to take advantage of thiscomfortable environment in order to make my life easier! All things considered, it seems to me that the best time to settle down on one’s own doesn’t necessarily coincide with the time when one leaves school.

Financial Markets A financial market is a place where firms and individuals enter into contacts or buy a specific product such as a stock or bond . Buyers seek to buy at the lowest available price and sellers seek to sell at thehighest available price. Personal benefit, sometimes called economic self-interest, motivates many people to invest in stocks and bonds. In the 1990s,about two of every five persons in the U.S.A own stock incorporations. People invest because they believe that it is possible togain more investments than from a basic bank savings program.

Read the text and do the activities below. Jackie Jones, 40, a part-time medical secretary from Essex, England, met up with her old school friend, Heather Gooch, three years ago, after finding her through the Friends Reunited website. Heather and I have known each other since we were five, but lost touch when Heather left school at 16, to work as a waitress, and I stayed on to do A-levels. We’d been such good friends at school, Iwas curious to see what she was doing now and hopeful that we would renew our friendship. So whenI saw something in the paper about the website, Friends Reunited, I logged on straight away. It wasvery easy to use. You create your own password, and then look up your school and the year you leftand up comes a list of names. I was very excited when I found Heather’s name in the list. We e-mailed each other at first, then spoke on the phone and decided to meet up. It was 23 years since we’d last seen each other, but therewas no awkwardness. We took up exactly where we’d left off. It was incredible at that time. It was asif we’d never been apart. We still have lots in common-we laugh at the same things, like the samemusic and our lives seem to have taken a similar path. She’s my best friend again. We e-mail each other every day and I see her at least once a week – we go to restaurants, wine bars, the cinema, and go shopping together. Heather’s family spent Christmas Day with us last yearbecause our husbands and daughters get on, too. It’s great. It’s a deeper kind of friendship than theone we had at school, which I think comes with age and experience. I feel I could turn to her for supportand hope she would do likewise. We’ve met up with a few other friends through the website and last year we organized a reunion. Nearly 40 people came then, which was lovely. When you have children, there was not always time to keep in touch with all your old friends. I’d made new friends through their primary school, but it’s lovely to have renewed a friendship from adifferent part of my life, and when we’re together we feel like we’re going to keep in touch forever now.

Classify your words into the table below. Study the words in the table below. Cross out those you can’t associate with communication . Read Text One and then do the activities below. Text 1 : The texter Although text messaging started out as a teen craze , it’s not just the under-24s who are hooked . From organising mass demonstrations to confessing undying love, the power of text messaging knows no limits,according to WAN2TLK?’s author, Gabrielle Mander. The text messager iseither trying to be fun and amusing or discreet,” she says. Social psychologist Dr Adam Johnson believes text messages provide an uninhibited form of communication and that we’re much more likely to flirt as a result. “Hidden aspects of ourselves surfacebecause of the visual anonymity involved with texting,” he says. Gabrielle Mander believes men are especially comfortable with text messaging as it allows them to be more romantically open. “Men don’t like being overheard or talking about their feelings face to face,”she explains. “They won’t say, I love you,’ on the phone, but they will in a text message; “Women alsoenjoy the discreet appeal of texting. “ A text message can’t be overheard like a phone call. And you candestroy the evidence quickly,” says Mander. Text messagers around the world now share jokes, secrets and feelings- but from a safe distance. According to Dr Adam Johnson, text messagers can be insecure , shy or needy. “Sometimes they’re desperate to receive messages that give them security or comfort,” he explains. www.eslmonkey.com 40Say whether the following statements are true or false. Give justifications from the text. a-Text messaging was started by teenagers. b-Text messaging can be used for various purposes. c-Text messaging makes people more open and less discreet. d-People like text messaging because they can easily destroy the evidence. Read the text again and replace the words in bold face with words from the box below without changing the original meaning. LANGUAGE PRACTICE • Look at paragraph two in text one and study the following two sentences. What is the relation between the two clauses in each sentence? a-Text messages provide an uninhibited form of communication and we’re much more likely to flirt as a result. b-Hidden aspects of ourselves surface because of the visual anonymity involved with texting. •Study the sentences below and show the Cause / Result relation . a-We didn’t go shopping because it was raining. b-She hadn’t received the first prize and she was disappointed as a result. c-She won’t be able to attend the ceremony since her husband has recently died. d-The book was so captivating that I had to read it all. e-We had such a wonderful weather during our holiday that we hated to fly back home. Read the following text then refer back to Text One and find out the advantages a texter can have and an e-mailer can’t . Text 2 : The e-mailer E-mailers desire control, according to Anne Warfield. “E-mail offers a clear, concise way to get the job done on your own terms. You can be in control of the content, when you send it and whenyou respond to messages. If you love e-mail, you’re probably a strategic planner and very goaloriented. When you enter a meeting you probably take up lots of space, spreading your papers onthe table.” Nicky Stanton, an engineer at BT, believes the e-mailer always has something specific to say- interesting, when you consider that one in ten women ditches her lover by e-mail.” E-mailers aremore interested in what they are saying than in how the other person reacts. The e-mailer makesless effort than the texter_ they don’t have to pick up a phone or find a number. They are at theirdesks and just click a button,” she says. “But the e-mailer can’t deal with conflict. The e-mailer whofires a member of staff or ditches a lover can’t handle emotionally the bad reception or hurt theyknow they’ve caused.” www.eslmonkey.com1 2 3 4addicted / fashion / free / proof / afraid 41Stage Three : On your own Can you read these messaging shortcuts ? ;-) UTLKIN2ME?

I think our problem is that we areboth quite impulsive people. We are alwaystrying to surprise each other.” 5After an 11,000-mile flight across the globe, she was greeted by Johnstone’sastonished flat mate asking what she was doingthere. 6“The awful truth dawned when I found that Ian’s rucksack and most of his clothes weremissing. I sat on the end of his bed and cried myeyes out,” she said.7Johnstone, a 27-year-old bricklayer, had taken a year off to travel round Australia. But hewas missing Dolby, a 26-year-old secretary, somuch he got a job on a Sydney building site andstarted saving for a surprise. 8He then flew to Britain and went to her apartment armed with an engagement ring,champagne and flowers. 9“I really missed Amy and I’d been thinking about her all the time. I thought she was windingme up when she phoned me from Australia,” hesaid. 10Johnstone then asked Dolby to marry him on the phone. “I didn’t know whether tolaugh or cry but I accepted,” she said. 11Dolby was given a tour of Sidney by Johnstone’s friends before sending her wearyway home. Johnstone had to stay in Britain fortwo weeks because he could not change histicket; www.english-to-go.com 55LESSON A3 Criss-Crossed Lovers Read the text and then do the activities. 56Read the following statements and say whether they are true, false or not mentioned in the text. a-Johnstone and Dolby are from Britain. b-They met in Britain. c-Johnstone decided to take a year off from work to travel around Australia. d-Johnstone got a job in Sydney so he could start saving money for a surprise flight to Britain. e-Dolby is older than Johnstone. f-It took Dolby 24 hours to get to Sydney from London. g-Johnstone was met at Dolby’s apartment door by her roommate. h-Johnstone stayed longer in Britain than Dolby stayed in Sydney. Guessing the meaning through context : The word “miss” is used in the article five times but with 3 different meanings which are : a-do not notice something or someone. b-something is not in its usual place. c-feel sad because the person is not with you. Look at the following excerpts from the passage and choose the best option (a, b or c) for each usage of “miss” . – Par. 1: Ian Johnstone missed his girlfriend so much he flew back to Britain from Australia to propose to her. ‘Missed’ means:– Par. 2: He and Amy Dolby even managed to miss each other in the airport lounge in Singapore.‘Miss’ means:– Par. 6: Ian’s rucksack and most of his clothes were missing.’ Missing’ means:– Par. 7: But he was missing Dolby so much he got a job on a Sydney building site and startedsaving for a surprise. ‘Missing’ means:– Par. 9: “I really missed Amy and I’d been thinking about her all the time.” ‘Missed’ means: Read the text and reorder the following events. Use numbers from 1 to 12. (Some of the events happened at the same time!) • Johnstone proposed to Dolby over the phone. • He started working at a Sydney building site. • Dolby returned to Britain. • Ian Johnstone flew to Britain. • Johnstone flew to Britain to propose to his girlfriend Amy Dolby. • She waited for her connecting flight in the airport lounge in Singapore. • Amy Dolby flew from London to see Ian Johnstone. • He waited for his connecting flight in the airport lounge in Singapore. • Johnstone went to Amy’s apartment in Britain but she wasn’t there. • Dolby called Johnstone from Australia. • Dolby was greeted at Ian’s flat by Ian’s flatmate. • Johnstone returned to Australia.1 2 3 574WRITING Amy is at Ian’s apartment in Sydney.

Too embarrassed to start a new job looking like that, I called in sick.They called back to say that the position had been filled by someone else.The next job I found was the one that brought your father and metogether.

Distribution of economically active children under 15 years of age (Percentage of total world labour) Child Labour 1The International Labour Organization (ILO) has estimated that 250 million children between the ages of five and fourteen work in developing countries-at least 120 million on a full time basis. Mostworking children in rural areas are found in agriculture; many children work as domestics; urbanchildren work in trade and services, with fewer in manufacturing and construction. 2Working children are the objects of extreme exploitation. They work the longest hours and are the worst paid of all labourers. They endure work conditions which include health hazards andpotential abuse. Many of them endure lives of pure deprivation. They’re deprived of the simple joysof childhood which together with hard work hinder their physical and mental development. 3Children work for a variety of reasons, the most important being poverty. Though children are not well paid, they still serve as major contributors to family income. They work to ensure thesurvival of their family and themselves. 4Schooling problems also contribute to child labour. Many times children seek employment simply because there’s no access to schools (distance, no school at all). When there’s access, thelow quality of the education often makes attendance a waste of time for the students.

Without parents or guardians, Justin had to drop out of school to earn a living, carrying food for merchants so he and his siblings could have enough to eat. www.unicef.org TEXT2 In Ethiopia, Meseret, 15, her brother Besufekad,11, and younger sister, 3, lost their parents in a road accident. So they moved in with their step-brother and his wife. The step-brother was poor anddidn’t have steady work. He also drinks, and the children said that he beat them. His wife made them work hard , and they had no time for school. Things came to a head when the step-brother made arrangements for Meseret to get married without her consent. So Masresha, her schoolteacher, packed up the children’s few belongings and moved them into her own home, where theyhave been living ever since. www.unicef.org TEXT3 Jimmy is 17 and lives in a foster home for troubled teens not far from New York City… “It all started when my father and mother met in a bar,” Jimmy said “.Most relationships that start like thisusually don’t turn out okay.” This one didn’t.

That is the latest advice from nutrition experts who have studied the health- promoting properties of the vast spectrum of colourful fruits and vegetables now available. 2Two recently published books "" What Color Is Your Diet ? "" and "" The Color Code "", both emphasize the importance of increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, and the need tochoose broadly among the richly colored options. The reward in terms of health and weight can beconsiderable. 3Nearly all fruits and vegetables are naturally very low in fat, loaded with filling fiber and with natural chemicals that can help protect against heart disease, cancer, age-related cognitive decline and cataracts of the eyes. Fruits and vegetables, with their vivid skins, are highly recommended byboth books for their health-promoting benefits. And even the paler members of thiscommunity_garlic, onions, cabbage, celery and the like_ have notable health-promoting virtues.TheColour Code "" gives a detailed account of the protective chemicals nature has bestowed upon various fruits and vegetables and how these chemicals can positively affect our different organs. 4Fruits and vegetables come closer than any other category of food to behaving like a fountain of youth. Yet, not all members of this community are alike. The authors of "" The Colour Code "" dividefruits and vegetables into four broad colour groups: red, orange-yellow, green and blue-purple, eachwith a different set of health promoting virtues. 5The message is clear for both books, and "" Pigment Power "" is what it is all about. We need to include as many plant-based colours in our daily diet as possible. In many cases, that meanseating the colourful skins, the richest sources of protective nutrients, along with the paler flesh. Sotry to avoid peeling foods like apples, peaches and eggplant or you will lose their most concentratedsource of beneficial chemicals.

Prepare arguments tosupport your choice and share with the rest of the class. a- Money is the root of all evil. b- Having much money often leads to corruption. c- Money is the source of happiness. d- Poverty is the root of all evil. e- Having little money leads to crime. f- Being rich is a sign of God’s choice. g- When you have money you have power. Read the text, then do the activities below. We must admit there is some truth in the famous saying: “money is the root of all evil”. First having much money certainly gives its possessor a feeling of superiority and self-satisfaction thatmay lead to tyranny and corruption. Very rich people generally think they can buy everything, eventhe honoured dignity of other people. They are alas; often successful because money has a strongappeal and many individuals can’t resist the magic power of money, even if they have to do thedirtiest things. Second, if you have enough money to pay for everything you want right away, youtend to become tired of pleasure. Because you can have things easily without being really sureyou like them or you need them, they start losing their values for you and you start missing thepleasures of life. But on the other hand, we can also say that the “lack of money is the root of all evil”. If you can’t afford a nice place to live in, if you are unable to provide your family with a decent standard of livingyou may resort to borrowing, cheating and even stealing to make ends meet. In such situationssome people may also turn to drinking to forget their worries and drown their misery. Some otherpeople may even resort to violence, crime and anarchy in order to get revenge on rich people andthe cruel world. It is clear therefore, that both plenty of money and the lack of it are evil. They may both lead to social calamities and moral decline. A better attitude towards money is to view it as “a good servantand a bad master”. We should never let money control our lives and haunt our dreams. www.pbs.org/newshour Stage Two : ReadingPower and happiness or evil and corruption? 74Complete the table with information from the text.1 Tick the right option : •In this text the author is: a-totally against having much money. b-totally against having little money. c-for a reasonable managing of money. •“They are alas, often successful”(par. 1) means : a-in fact they are successful. b-unfortunately they are successful. c-fortunately they are successful.

This happened after his wife Sally came to the office whilehe was in a “ not-to be-disturbed meeting "" with Lucy, one of the company’s financial team. 2Naturally, I’d told his wife that he was busy, but as soon as “the meeting” was over, he called me into his office. He told me he needed my cooperation to keep his affair secret. I was shocked.He seemed anxious to know whether I could keep it a secret, so I assured him that he could trustme. He said I’d get a 15% pay rise immediately. I felt even more embarrassed. It was clear I wasbeing paid not only to keep his affair secret, but also to lie for him . 3The next day he bought a mobile phone for “emergency” use. Only he and I had the number and he said I was only to call him on it if his wife or mistress became too suspicious. I was becomingpart of his messy private life. Yet I couldn’t afford to say no to the new salary. Could I? 4As time went by however, the lies began really to affect me. I felt sorry for both the wife and the mistress. I wouldn’t want to be in their situation after all. As for James, he started to lookincreasingly worried and upset. He wanted to save his marriage and end the affair with Lucy. Whenhe asked me to help close his affair with Lucy, I almost refused. But he talked me round and promised another pay rise. From then on, whenever Lucy phoned I lied to her and found excusesnot to put her call through. She got increasingly upset and aggressive on the phone, and I felt sickevery time I lied to her. 5One day, Lucy rushed into the office while James was at lunch with his wife. She demanded I tell her where he was, so I said he was out with a client. I was humiliated when she accused me,in front of the whole office, of lying for him and getting money for that. “This was the last time” I saidto myself. “He had to do his own dirty work from now on.”The next day, I resigned and decided to find a new job with no lies and no deceit.

A. The writer was a b- slave owner. c- slave trader. a-a biography. B.The text is taken from b- a school book. c- an autobiography. I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the larger partof the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masterswithin my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant. I was not allowed to make any inquiries ofmy master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper andimpertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsy Bailey, both colored, and quite dark. My father was a white man. The opinion was whispered that my masterwas my father. My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant, before I knew her as mymother. It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children fromtheir mothers at a very early age. I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night. She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who livedabout twelve miles from my home. She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling thewhole distance on foot, after the performance of her day’s work. She was a field hand, and awhipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She was with me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I woke up she was gone. Verylittle communication ever took place between us. Death soon ended what little we could have whileshe lived, and with it her hardships and suffering. She died when I was about seven years old, onone of my master’s farms, near Lee’s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at herdeath, or burial. She was gone long before I knew anything about it. Never having enjoyed, to anyconsiderable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care. I received the tidings ofher death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.

NB: There’s one extra item in “B”. 101Sue : You don’t necessarily lose your own individuality by wearing a uniform; there’s still something special about yourself as aperson. Just because you’re wearing thesame things, it doesn’t make you all thesame; it doesn’t matter what anyone elsethinks. Don’t worry about things like that. Katie : I think that by putting us all in the same uniform, they suppress our identities; and they’re saying like “oh we all have to lookthe same; we all have to think the same.”That’s how it seems to me. Sarah : I think, um… I came from primary school, and we didn’t have to wear a uniform there; and coming to secondary school andwearing a uniform, I don’t know, I really enjoyed it; I used to beproud of it, of wearing it.

Pushy Parents are here to stay 1Every autumn, as students start the business of selecting a university, stories appear in the media about pushy parents who insist on expressing views about where their offspring should go. 2For the last two decades there has been a growing involvement of parents in all stages in achild’s education. I have stood in queues inschools and heard parents telling their offspringwhat they should and shouldn’t take for GCSE. Asample of quotes overheard recently include: “NotFrench, that’s a waste of time"";"" music is to bedropped"";""let’s get over to the economics teacher”;and,"" I’ve told you, you’re not taking any uselesssubject like Latin.” Teachers confirm that parentsplay a huge role in determining what their childrenwill study, and that continues at A-level. By thetime they are selecting a university, Mum and Dad(more often Mum, apparently) are major players. 3Increased parental involvement is part of a shift in British culture that has seen the nature of parenting change. Battles to get children into good nurseries are a fact of life, as is the decision ofmany parents to select a primary school as soon as a child is born. Today more and more childrengrow up continuously shepherded about by adults, unable to walk the streets alone or to disappearout to play. 108Stage One : LESSON A7 Pushy Parents Speaking Stage Two : Reading Comprehension 1 2 1 4This increased concern shown by millions of parents over children’s welfare ___________ even how university education is perceived.

It was unusual in those days and people in the office made me feel guilty by saying, ‘How could you’, butI had no choice. We needed the money. 3For five years I worked for the printing Federation, ending up in charge of administration. I joined BT as a clerical officer in 1975, when Donovan was eight. I later moved into planning andthen management. I felt terrible about not being there when Donovan got home from school. 4“I had to drop him at the childminder’s house at 7 a.m, on my way to catch the train to work.

Read the text and do the activities below. 1I teach children music. Nothing strange about that, you might think. Except that I’m deaf. I was born partially deaf and I wear a hearing aid in each ear, but even when I was a little girl I lovedplaying the piano and triangle. My mum got so fed up with the noise that she booked me in for piano lessons. 2Right from the start I was hooked , even though it was sometimes hard for me to get the right pitch . But I learnt never to use my deafness as an excuse. I’d spend hours practising to get the tunes right and when I was 11, I won a scholarship to music school. 3Since then, I’ve never looked back. I play the French horn, violin, piano and trumpet and passed exams and diplomas so that I can teach too. 4I used to work with drama and dance companies, but when I was 30 I helped a friend organise a concert for children. It was so much fun and so rewarding that I decided to work withchildren. I set up my own company. The Music House for Children and taught piano lessons. 5Now I’m 36, I employ 30 music teachers and we teach nearly 300 children all over London. I also work with deaf children at a special school. It makes it all worthwhile when I see these children light up . It reminds me how far I’ve come from that little deaf girl who used to bang the piano so tunelessly. Emma Hutchinson , 36.

Dear Sir, I was surprised to read your recent editorial on the question of students’ part-time jobs. You appear to bemaking a lot of generalisations on the basis of just oneunfortunate incident (I assure you that not all youngpeople who deliver newspapers are as foolish anddishonest as the two youths mentioned in your article). The first point I would like to make is that there are many jobs teenagers can do which give them usefulexperience of the working world. They are brought intocontact with a variety of people, often older, and aregiven experience of expressing themselves clearly andcoherently. I am thinking here of jobs such as travelguides and shop assistants. Another argument for schoolchildren and college students having holiday or weekend jobs is that many parents need the financial assistance. If we take, for example, a family in which the fatheris unemployed or perhaps a single-parent family on a low income, it seems logical and fair that ason or daughter should try to bring money into the household. One further thing I want to say is that a lot of jobs for the young can be fun for the people who do them and also useful to the community. Youngsters who help in schools, hospitals and with theelderly often derive a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction as well as contributing somethingvaluable to local society. In conclusion, I would add that when I was a girl, my father said my teens were a time for books, hobbies and academic studies. Thinking back, I feel I would have learnt much more-about myself,other people and life in general-if he had allowed me to do a limited amount of real work. Certainly,when she is old enough, I shall encourage my own daughter to do so, rather than waste her timewith soap operas, computer games and discotheques, like so many young people today. Yours faithfully, Margaret Williams (Mrs) www.miguelmllop.com 121LESSON A8 Part-Time Jobs Say whether the following statements are true or false.

Read the text, and then do the activities below. The importance of libraries 1Librarians, and the people who support libraries make use of the library's wonders. They are, according to me, the heroes of civilization. These people, in their quiet way, have maintained one ofcivilization's great traditions: the gathering of the human life experience. In this way, libraries havebeen and shall always be the engines of civilization's progress.Stage One : LESSON 23 Pre-Reading Stage Two : ReadingThe importance of libraries 1 2N........... Ma...........Ca........... Jo........... At...........M........... V...........D...........Books Enc...........Library 2In fact, without libraries, such progress would be impossible, especially in our modern era. These days, we all depend upon libraries. We can explore the thoughts and actions of others. Andthat gives us a remarkable power to change and grow and do things better. 3Good films or television programs have their place, but when you really need to understand a question in depth, you've got to turn to books. And because books are so expensive these days,libraries have become very important to ensure that reading doesn't become a hobby for the rich. 4Books are the lifeblood of the library because they enlighten our world, and encourage the expansion of culture. With these words in mind, I think we owe it to ourselves and to futuregenerations to serve others by keeping learning and literacy alive. The future of the countryabsolutely depends on a literate population, and reaching that goal involves strong supportof our public schools, universities, and public libraries. 5If I could give young people a valuable gift, it would be a good education, an education rich in literature, science, mathematics, history, crafts, sport, and the fine arts. It would be an educationwith no shortage of excellent teachers and a full supply of the world's best books. I do stronglybelieve that “the more you read, the more you know. The more you know, the smarter you grow….”So, let’s pay tribute to our teachers and take good care of our libraries. By Honorable Lois E.

Identify employed individuals who may be able to supply you with current, comprehensiveinformation about your ideal job. Begin with those persons most easily accessible to you; yourfamily, friends, school, and or other resources.Before you meet for the interview remember to: •Learn as much as you can about the field of work and the person you will be interviewing. •Prepare a list of questions you want to ask. •Be prepared to take notes during the interview. •Express interest and appreciation. 128 In pairs discuss the following questions. •Who is your favourite singer? Why? •How many hours a week do you listen to music? •Where and when do you listen to music? •Do you spend any money on C.Ds ,cassettes and albums? Report any differences to the rest of the class. Death of the Single 1No one doubts that they once were the passion of teenagers, the first thing they spent their pocket money or tiny pay packets on. Everyone wanted the latest single, and programmes such asTop of the Pops succeeded on them .But not any more . The single may have had its day, killed off by the internet, MTV and mobile phones. 2In the UK music sales have been falling down steadily, and singles in particular are badly hit. In the third week of January 2002, just 400.000 singles were bought across the UK, the worstperformance in 35 years and just half of those sold in the same week four years ago. A mere 10singles managed to sell more than 10.000 copies, compared to three times that amount five yearsearlier. 3In the same year, 2002, in the USA music sales overall plunged by nearly 9 percent. The only exception was Eminem the Detroit-based rapper-turned-actor, who has plenty to celebrate. Eminemwas the only artist in 2002 to surpass the 5 million mark. Industry wide, total sales fell 8.7 percentfrom 2001 to nearly 650 million units the second year-to-year decline in a row. 4Dr. Fox, who hosts the Hit 40 UK chart show on Sunday nights, says: “When I was a kid all we had was Top of the Pops and Radio One. There was nowhere else to go to for the latest songs. So, if you loved something , you had to buy it .You couldn’t get it anywhere else, but now there are so many places you can hear your favourite music. Twenty years ago you didn’t have 10 differentmusic channels or 300 radio stations playing pop music.” And he also blamed the endless supply ofcompilation albums. He says: “The record companies have only themselves to blame. Just aboutevery single released will be on compilation album the same week. “Would you want to spend threepounds on one song or get 40 track for a few more?” With CD albums costing as little as £8.50compared to £3 to £5 for singles, it is not surprising people are shunning singles. Another nail inthe single’s coffin is the speed at which artists release a new album after their single hits the chart. 129Stage One : LESSON 24 Speaking Stage Two : ReadingDeath of the Single 1 2 5In the last decade the pop music world has become highly competitive, and the drop in singles sales is the first casualty of a bitter battle for supremacy. Today there are so many moreways of getting hold of a song than just buying the single or the album. Pop fans can downloadtracks from the internet, buy them as ring tone for their mobile phone, or record them from MTV.Another cause of the slump in the overall sales is that radio stations now play songs for up to twomonths before they are released , boring potential customers to death before the single or thealbum is even in the shops. www.english-to-go.com Glossary : A single is a musical record that has only one song on each side.

At the end of each day, some people like to sit and write down the things that happened during that day. Sometimes they describe events, and sometimes they include their own feelings aboutthose events. Very often, these people write in a special book called a diary. Each time they write, the section of the diary that they write is called an entry. An entry usually begins with the time of writing:Thursday, March 17 or Thursday evening or Thursday, March 17, 8:00p.m. You are going to write an entry in a diary. Activity 1 : Writing about past events. a-Think of a particular day you would like to describe. Try to remember the events of that day. Then write about the day and the things that happened. Beginyour diary entry with the day and date on which you are writing. Follow theexample below, but use your own day and date, and of course your own events. Tuesday, Nov.10- Yesterday was a wonderful day for me. I got a nice long letter from my Swedish pen friend. I felt very happy when I …………… b-Now write a diary entry of your own. It does not have to be a long one. Here are some questions that may help you decide what to write. How did the day begin? What was the first thing that happened that day?How did you feel at the beginning of the day?Did any thing important happen that day? Interesting? Amusing? Good? Bad? Were there any surprises for you that day?All in all, was it a good day? A bad day? An ordinary day? Sometimes a diary entry is in the past tense, sometimes in the present, and sometimes in the future. When the entry is in the present tense, it is usually because the person is describing how heor she feels at the moment and what he or she is thinking about. Very often such an entry includesopinions or beliefs about certain things. How do we express our opinions? We use verbs like think, believe, and feel. We begin with phrases like in my opinion, if you ask me, as far as I’m concerned or it seems to me that. And weuse auxiliaries like should and modifiers like too (too much, too many) and enough (enough, notenough). Activity 2 : Writing about personal opinions. In this activity there is a list of five topics. After each topic, write some opinion about that topic using one of the words and phrases from the list below. If you have no opinion about a particulartopic, state the opinion of another person or other people (My friend believes……or In the opinionof some people………). 133LESSON A9 Keeping a Diary think should believe too muchfeel too many in my opinion if you ask me, not enoughas far as I am concerned, enough it seems to me that Olive oil ............................................................................................................................... .............. ............................................................................................................................... ...............………… .................................................................

Step 2 : With your partners, discuss the use of internet, with a focus on arguments for and arguments against. Step 3 : Individual work: Examine the pictures and answer the self-test questions, then define what an internet addict is. Is there a solution to this problem? 138Stage One : LESSON 25 Pre-ReadingInternet Addiction How to survive the internet? Some people just can’t stop clicking. Internet addicts “need help”. The escape key could provide a way out. “Internet addiction is a growing problem and doctors should be better equipped to deal with it”, a research from the Centrefor Online Addiction suggests. Self test reveals all : Answer the following questions with ‘yes’ or ‘no ’. •Do you feel preoccupied with the Internet (you think about your previous online activity or anticipate your next session)? •Do you feel the need to use the Internet with increasing amounts of time in order to achieve satisfaction? •Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use? •Do you stay online longer than originally intended? •Have you risked the loss of a significant relation, job, educational or career opportunity because of the Internet? •Have you lied to family members, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with the Internet? •Do you use the Internet as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving, for example, feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety or depression? Interpretation : If you answered ‘yes ‘to at least five of the questions above, you are an addict. Join a group to read one of the following passages. After reading, each group answers the following : Who ? What ? Why ? 139Stage Two : Reading 1 1- Yes, I use the internet, but I can happily live without it. I just wish this was the case with my wife. When she gets in from work, the PC goes on and it can be 5 or more hours before she logs off.At the same time the mobile phone is constantly going as she talks to people she's having anonline conversation with. It's not uncommon for her to be talking to one person about threedifferent things in three different chat rooms. Our marriage is suffering as a result, as is herrelationship with her son. But how do you get someone to acknowledge it as a problem? If Imention it to my wife, she becomes very aggressive and defensive, so how can I help her? Ian,England 2- Hmmm, sitting in front of a computer screen for seven hours a night. A lot of people sit in front of their TVs for similar amounts of time. Is this not just as bad (if not worse - there's absolutely nointeractivity)? I don't have a TV and experienced similar feelings of 'wow’! Personally I think it isfar healthier to be surfing the internet for hours than mindlessly drooling in front of the one-eyedgod. Sam, UK Each group leader reports the answers to the others. Re-read the four passages and decide whether each speaker is for or against internet excessive use, then pick up the arguments each speaker gives to defendhis/her attitude. LANGUAGE PRACTICE a-Read the following sentence and focus on the underlined parts. I'mone of those who met herfiancé through cyberspace. b-Now rewrite the same sentence and start as given. Manal said ………………………………………………………… c-Have you noticed the changes? What are they? d-With those changes in mind, now rewrite text number 4. 1403- If I spend hours on the phone talking to friends and family, I'm seen as sociable and caring. If I spend those hours e-mailing the same people, or chatting to them, I'm a geek who's out of touchwith ""real life"". Surely in this technologically advanced age we should be putting such irrationalprejudices behind us and learning to value communication in all its forms? Janet, UK 4- I am one of those who met her fiancé through cyberspace. However, soon after we met up in person, my excessive love of the internet cost me engagement. We loved each other very much, except the problem of chatting on the internet. He asked me tostop chatting on the Internet because he was jealous and the jealousy developed into lack ofconfidence. He made it clear later that I have to stop chatting with other men. I couldn't stop. Ineed to feel closer to the rest of the world, so we broke up. Manel Ali Egypt 2 3 4Speaker For / Against Arguments Sam Janet Ian Manel Many students in your school are “library-lovers’ and keep writing articles in the school magazine where they criticize the overuse of Internet. You have decided to write an article in the same magazinewhere you highlight the benefits of reasonable use of internet. CAREER RESEARCH PROJECT Step 4 : Career Presentation. You have explored various sources to get the maximum information about your favourite career or your dream job. Now you will need to develop a presentation todeliver to your classmates. This will be the assessment of your knowledge of thiscareer. Following are the requirements of what needs to be included in this presentation : •A description of the work. •Wage/salary (entry level and after established in career). •What characteristics are needed for a person to be most in this career? •Educational background needed. •Where can you get the education/qualifications needed for this career? •Advantages/disadvantages of the job. •Career ladder. •Employment outlook/ future developments. NB. Use appropriate visuals and power point, dress up for the job if you can to improve your presentation. Remember that a written report should be turned in with all the above information. 141Stage Three : Writing 142a-Pair Work: With your partner go through the following statements and tick the ones you mostly agree with. Thanks to the development in science and technology, in the future man will : •Grow stronger and healthier. •Be taller/ shorter. •Live longer. •Have larger brains. •Have more children. •Have weaker senses. b-Now report and explain your choice to the rest of the class. Listen and tick the best answer. •The text tells us a great deal about how future man will : a-look b-live c-feel •The reason for believing that future man will be different is that he: a-never stops changing b-never stops growing c-has recently begun to change •People’s heads will eventually grow larger. This is because their brains will: a-grow faster b-be in constant use c-work less •Future man will probably: a-have bigger eyes b-see better c-have better glasses •Future man’s hair will: a-stop growing completely b-fall out more often c-grow faster Listen and say whether the following statements are true or false. (Section1) •500 years ago, man was shorter than he is now. •Today, we use about 23% of the brain’s capacity. (Section2) •In the future, our fingers will grow less and less sensitive. •In the future man will look more attractive. •Future man will no longer have any feelings.Stage One : LESSON 26 Pre-Listening Stage Two : ListeningWhat will man be like? 1 2 PRONUNCIATION a-Listen and classify the words below under the corresponding heading. b-Listen and classify the words below as indicated in the table.

Selling a business is different from selling any other asset one owns, because a business is more than an income earning asset. It is a lifestyle as well. Therefore, the decision to sell it can bedifficult. Personal ambitions should be weighed against economic consequences to make a properlybalanced decision to sell or not to sell. 2It is said that timing is everything, and certainly that old saying is true when we sell a business. Intelligent business owners carefully plan out the decision to sell. They recognize that abusiness should be sold only after proper preparation and not because of sudden personalproblems or a short-term crisis in business. 3For a wise business owner that proper preparation means the business should be clean, the inventory current, and the equipment in good working order. Moreover, a valuation report and abusiness presentation package should be prepared. The valuation report eliminates guesswork andgives the exact value of the asset. The presentation package should cover all the facets of thebusiness. They include: • A history of the business. • A description of how the business operates.• A description of the facilities.• A discussion of suppliers.• A review of marketing practices.• A description of the competition.• A review of personnel including an organizational chart, description of job responsibilities, rates of pay, and willingness of key employees to stay on after the sale. Answer the following questions. a-Why is selling a business different from selling other possessions? (par. 1) b-What must intelligent business owners avoid when selling an asset? (par.2) c-Why is a valuation report necessary? (par.3)LESSON E10 Selling a business 1 The table below is about the preparations needed before selling an asset.

That would be very dangerous as it would, among other things, damage crops and cause cancer in humans. Global warming is a fact today. Global average temperatures have risen about 1°c in the past century and will probably continue to rise, jumping as much as 5°c overthe next century. That means sea levels will be high enough to cover coastal areas and river deltas and endanger more than 100 million people. 148 Tropical rain forests are the site of great damage. Although they cover only 6% of the land surface, they contain more than half the species of plants and animals ofthe entire world. The rate of clearing and burning of rain forests is too high to be ignored . Every year 0.25% or more of the forest species are becoming extinct. Time , October 30, 1995 149 Pollution and over fishing destroy the oceans: coralreefs are being wiped outand whales, dolphins andother sea mammals arebeing threatened byextinction. Questions : a-What happens when the ozone layer is damaged? b-What are the effects of global warming? Do you know other effects? c-Name some victims of sea pollution and over fishing. d-What’s happening to rainforests? How does that affect wildlife? LANGUAGE PRACTICE a- Focus on the underlined word in the sentence below and guess whether it is: •an adverb of place •an adverb of degree or •an adverb of manner. This would be very dangerous. b- Do you know other adverbs of the same type? c- Read the sentences below, notice the place of the adverb, then match the adverbs with their corresponding degrees. •Your work is quite good. •He’s old enough to get to school. •The story is very amusing. •It’s still too cold to swim. d- Focus on the following sentences and find out : – how many clauses (parts) there are in each one. – the relation between the two clauses. and – whether the action is possible in each sentence. •Sea levels will be high enough to cover coastal areas. •The rate of clearing and burning of rainforests is too high to be ignored. e- Combine by means of “enough… to” or “too …to.” (The first 2 examples have been done for you.) •You’re very young. You can’t understand. You’re too young to understand. •She’s old. She can travel by herself. She is old enough to travel by herself. •The plate is very hot. I can’t touch. •He’s very tall. He can see over the heads of other people. •The ice is not very thick. We can’t walk on it. •The parcel is very heavy. We can’t send it by post. •The case is very light. I can carry it. •The grass is very wet. We can’t sit on it. 1502 Adverb Degree 1- quite 2- enough3- very4- tooa- high degree b- excessive degree c- moderate degree d- sufficient degree With a partner select the most important measures and discuss them to say whether they’re practical and effective to save the environment. Be ready toshare with the rest of the class. •Reduce the number of vehicles and factories. •Filter toxic fumes of factories and vehicles. •Purify waste water. •Look for an alternative non polluting source of energy. •Stop producing ozone- damaging chemicals. •Ban nuclear experiments. •Recycle waste products. •Safeguard rainforests and ban deforestation. •Protect endangered species. •Build wildlife conservation areas. •Plant trees. •Encourage voluntary work and voluntary organizations. •Pass laws to regulate the exploitation of the seas and the oceans. •Educate people and make them more ecology conscious. There have always been greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and a greenhouse effect on earth. But such gases are building up –we pump millions of tons of carbon into the air each year– and scientists are uncertain about the long-term impact on the planet’s climate. 151Stage Three : Speaking A quiz : In your family, are you considerate consumers of water ? •Do you have a bath or a shower when you use the bathroom? •Do you water your garden in the evening or in full sunshine? •Do you use a vessel or running water when youwash up the dishes? •Do you use a bucket of water and a rag or a water hose when you wipe the floor? •Do you use a bucket of water and a rag or a water hose when you clean the family’s car? •Have you got a water well at home? •Do you have economical water equipment at home? ( special taps – special meters…) •Do you deal with repairs in the water pipes / in the taps as soon as possible? •Do you notify the “SONEDE” as soon as you detect any leakage in the water mains? Read the scrambled paragraphs and a-cross out the irrelevant one. b-rearrange the others to get a coherent text. 152Stage One : LESSON 28 Pre-Reading Stage Two : ReadingWater Scarcity Water is life 1 A-Population growth is the main cause. The rise of human numbers to more than six billion in the year 2000 meant that water consumption almost doubled in half a century. Demand ofcourse comes not only from the need to drink, the need to wash, and the need to deal with human waste, but also from industry in the developed world and from agriculture in the developing world. B-Mankind’s most serious challenge in the 21st century might not be war or hunger or disease, a UN report says; it may be the lack of fresh water. Although water is the commonest thing on Earth, only 2.5 percent of it is fresh, while the rest is salt. What is available, in lakes, rivers,aquifers, (ground water) and rainfall run-off, is now increasingly coming under pressure fromseveral directions. 2003 Independent Digital (UK) Ltd. Read paragraph B and find an expression that explains the title“water scarcity.” LANGUAGE PRACTICE a-Focus on the underlined parts in the following sentence and guess the relation between part 1 and part 2. Do you think the relation shows: a-addition? b-opposition? or c-result? 1 Demand comes not only from the need to drink, the need to wash, and the need 2 to deal with human waste but also from industry in the developed world and from agriculture in the developing world. b- Express differently using “not only… but also.”(Number 1 has been done for you.) •It’s cold and wet in the North: It’s not only cold but also wet in the North. •He’s deaf and dumb. •Both his father and his mother are dead. •Both Peter and John are pop fans. •They both smoke and drink. •He can speak both English and German. •She can play the guitar and the drum. •He has the time and the money to play polo. •He dislikes the way we speak and disapproves of the way we dress. •They broke into his office, stole his books and tore up his manuscripts. 153C-Irrigation has played a major role historically in poverty alleviation by providing food security, protection against famine, and expanded opportunities for employment both on and off the farm.Development of irrigated agriculture has been a major engine for economic growth and povertyreduction. D-All that’s bad enough. But what’s increasing the stress on water supply still further is climate change which will probably account for a fifth of the increase in water scarcity. Because of globalwarming, rainfall is predicted to decrease not only in drought-prone countries, but also in tropical regions. 2 1Stage Three : c-With the help of your teacher complete the table below. SPEAKING Pair work : Discuss these points with a partner. With reference to “Stage One”, water scarcity is a serious problem in Tunisia. a- Are there any practical efforts to reduce the effects of water scarcity? – Is the government building any dams, any mountain lakes…? – Is there any drilling for deep sources of ground water? b-What can you do as individuals? 154Structure Meaning/Function Example Not only…but also …………………………............ …………………………............ 2 Victims of drought 155Pair Work : Hidden Words Puzzle.

Distance learning has been around for a long time. For hundreds of years instructors (are teaching - taught -have taught) students across great distances via correspondence courses using printed materials. The early days of television (will witness - witnessed - would witness) the introduction of televised courses. Today, in a specially equipped facility, an instructor (can - could - was able to) teach several classrooms (filled - filling - full) of students brought together through interactive television. Early online courses using electronic mail (had rapidly followed - were rapidly followed - were rapidly following) by web-based instruction. Today, the lines are blurred between different types of distance learning courses as multiple modes of delivery areemployed in a single course. For example, a class ""library"" could be a website; class discussionscould take place (using - used - usage) electronic mail; some course content could be delivered using printed materials and television; and the final activity could be a place-bound proctored exam. Put the bracketed words in the right tense or form. Now you 1 (read) , not passively, but actively with definite questions you wish to answer in mind. Read for main ideas and important details. When you 2 (reach) the end of a headed section, go back and mark the main idea. Use your own system of 3 (mark) , but whatever you use, 4 (use) it consistently. You can 5 (choice) to underline, highlight, write key words in the margin, bracket 6(significance) paragraphs, etc. Indicate the relationships among main ideas by joining a word or two in the margin, or by using arrows to connect ideas. Make your marks simple and have a goodreason for every mark you make. Whatever system you use, 7 (not overdo) it; highlighting everything is no 8 (good) than highlighting nothing. 162LESSON 30 Progress check 3 1 2 3 4caring – life – who – programs - choose – reached -of – school – addicted – occasionally Write the following words or expressions under the appropriate heading.

With an increasing population, the problems created by overpopulationgrow correspondingly. To ensure population stability not only in the third-world areas, but also in theindustrialized areas, countries and individuals must work together to achieve zero populationgrowth. Correct the underlined mistakes. Air pollution can be deadly even if we can’t see it. It cause lung disease and cancer. It poisons river and lakes, damages trees and kills wildlife. It has an influence mainly on old people and those with hart disease are on greatest risk of premature mortality due to particulate air pollution.

Grammar summary Want and would like are used to express a desire. Would like can be used instead of the present tense of the verb want and is a more polite form. Instead of I want to see Mr. Pitt. We can say I would like to see Mr. Pitt. These two verbs can be followed by infinitives, not clauses. I would like to go to Oxford. She wants to give support to her relatives. They can be followed by a Noun Phrase (N P) and a full infinitive. She would like her daughter to become a doctor. He wants his friend to visit him again. 1- Form The present perfect is formed with the present tense of to have + the past participle of the verb . I have worked . 2- Use The present perfect can be used with :a-a time expression to indicate that the action began in the past and continues in the present. He has been in the army fortwo years. (he is still in the army). I have smoked since I left school. (I still smoke). 166Lesson one : Would like / want Lesson two : The present perfect with Since , for,just, yet already and adverbs of frequency.Structure Function / meaning would like + to + verb desire want + to + verb Structure Function / meaning would like + NP + full infinitive Want / desire want + NP + full infinitive Foris used with a period of time; Example: for six days, for a long time. Since is used with a point in time and it means “from that point to the time of speaking.” Example: Since 1960, since yesterday. b-just to express a recently completed action. Past just Now I have just gone out = I went out a few minutes ago. Just must be placed between the auxiliary and the main verb. c-yet in a negative sentence to show that the action began in the past and continues in the present. The position of yet is at the end of the sentence. They haven’t finished yet. d-already in an affirmative sentence to show that the action began in the past and was finished at an indefinite time. I have already finished those exercises. e-frequency adverbs . He has never seen a serpent. I have always written with my left hand. N.B.: Never and always are placed between the auxiliary and the main verb. 1-The word agofollows an expression of time. It indicates the simple past. a-I saw Alice two days ago. b-John left a few minutes ago. c-That happened a long time ago. 2-Then or at that time can replace expressions of time. a-The war began in 1939.At that time, it was difficult for everyone to live comfortably. b-Mary came at ten o’clock and Tom came then, too. 167Lesson three : The simple past with ago, at that time , then Structure Meaning tense ago a time prior to the present. The simple past at that time then The cause / result relationship is expressed with words like: because, as, so, since, so…..that, such….that – which join two sentences. Examples: He felt cold. He built a fire.He felt cold so he built a fire.He built a fire because he felt cold. The first sentence is the cause of building fire. The second sentence is the result of feeling cold. – We camped there because it was too dark to go on . – As we hadn’t any money , we couldn’t buy anything to eat. – Since you are unable to answer perhaps we should ask someone else. The underlined clauses show the cause. His speech went on for so long that people began to fall asleep . They had such a fierce dog that no one dared to go near their house . The underlined clauses show the result. The word either is frequently added at the end of a two-clause sentence. I haven’t seen the movie, and my friend hasn’t, either. Do Mary and Margaret both want bananas? Mary doesn’t want any, and Margaret doesn’t, either . The same construction can be used in the affirmative with as well or too. I went and she went, as well . They did it, and you did it, too. Form This tense is formed by the present perfect of the verb to be +the present participle: (V. + ing) 168Lesson five : Cause / result relationship Lesson six : Either in end position (negative) Lesson seven : The present perfect progressiveEither is used in negative statements and answers after not to indicate an additional negative item or idea. It is usually at the end of the sentence. – affirmative : I’ve been working. He has been working. – negative : I have not (haven’t) been working. – interrogative : have you been working? – Negative interrogative : haven’t you been working? Use Past Present This tense is used for an action which began in the past and is still in progress , Past just orhas only just finished, now I’ve been waiting for an hour and he still hasn’t turned up. I have been driving since 9:00 and I haven’t arrived yet.I’m so sorry I’m late. Have you been waiting long? All English nouns can be divided into two classes: those that are countable and those that are uncountable. A countable noun is, by definition, one that can be preceded by one (or a or an), two, three, etc. An uncountable noun is one that can not be preceded by a cardinal number. The comparative shows differences (contrasts) between two things or groups. The superlative shows differences in three or more things or groups. 169Lesson nine : Countable / uncountable nouns Lesson ten : The comparative /superlativeCountable nouns Uncountable nouns - Have singular and plural forms. - Have only one form. - Take singular and plural verbs. - Take only singular verbs. - Have a, anor onebefore them as modifier in the singular.- Can not have a, an, or one beforethem as modifier. - Can have many or fewbefore them as modifier in the plural.- Can have much before them as a modifier. - Can have some before them as modifier only in the plural.- Can have some before them as a modifier. - Can have number of before them only in the plural.- Can have amount of before them. 1-With one-syllable adjectives, add erfor the comparative and estfor the superlative. John is younger than Paul. John is the youngest boy in our class. 2-For adjectives of more than two syllables we make the comparative form with more and the superlative form with most . Industrious more industrious the most industrious Two –syllable adjectives ending in –fulor reusually take more and most. doubtful more doubtful the most doubtful mature more mature the most mature Two syllable adjectives ending in -er or –yusually add erand est. tender tenderer the tenderestpretty prettier the prettiest N.B.: Use more and most before past participles (-ed verb forms). tired more tired than the most tired of all 3-Some adjectives have irregular forms . 170Adjective Comparative Superlative - young - tall- fast- few- young er - taller - fast er - few er- the young est - the tall est - the fast est - the few est Adjective Comparative Superlative - good- bad- little- much- many- far- better - worse - less - more - more - farther further - the best (of all)- the worst (of all)- the least (of all)- the most of (all)- the most (of all)- (the) farthest (of all)- (the) furthest (of all) Lesson eleven : Causative verbs + bare infinitive •To make somebody do something. - She made her daughter clean the house. •To letsomebody do something. - Don’t let the children play with the matches. •To have somebody do something. - Emma hadeveryone come to her party. 1-The passive is used : a- When the actor is not known, unimportant, or obvious or wishes to be unknown. I was robbed of my watch. ( The actor is unknown). b-In certain styles of scientific writing. The steam engine was invented in the eighteenth century. c-In writing about disasters and accidents if the result or the victim is more important than the cause. Mr. Johnson’s house was destroyed by the floods. N.B.: by + agent after a passive verb gives the same information that the active subject gives in the active voice . The steam engine was invented by James Watt . James Watt invented the steam engine. 2-Changes from active to passive voice; a-The active object passive subject. b-The passive verb is composed of: to be + past participle. c-“Be” must follow the same tense / form of the active verb. Mary completed the experiment. subject verb object The experiment was completed by Mary. subject verb agent 171Lesson twelve : Lesson fourteen : conjunctions Function / meaning Examples Therefore Cause / Effect (result)It began to rain; therefore , I opened my umbrella. As a result It has rained heavily; as a result ,many houses are flooded. That’s why It’s Sunday; that’s why most shops are closed. •Positive statement Negative tag •Negative statement Positive tag. •The mail has come, hasn’t it ? •It’s raining outside, isn’t it ?•The mail hasn’t come today, has it ? •It isn’t raining, is it? N.B.: The tag questions are questions asking for agreement or disagreement at the end of a statement . They are used in speech more than in writing. Tag questions Lesson fifteen The passive 3-The structure of the passive : Must + infinitive expresses obligation. You must stop at the red lights. - Must + infinitive expresses necessity. You must pass a test before you enter the computer course. - Must + be expresses deduction. She came in with her umbrella dripping; it must be raining outside. 172Passive subject + be (tense / form) + past participle (+by + agent) Quantifier Meaning - A few + countable noun(s). - A little + non-countable noun. - A lot of + countable nouns. + non-countable noun• not many but enough. • not much but enough. many/plenty of. much./plenty of. • We have a few minutes to spare; there’s no need to hurry. • There’s no need to hurry; we still have a little time left. • I’ve made a lot of mistakes .

Reflexive pronouns Singular form Plural form - myself - yourself- himself- herself- itself- ourselves- yourselves- themselves • I cut myself while shaving. • You’d better rely on yourself . • The mother told her kids to behave themselves in the presence of guests.Lesson sixteen Lesson eighteen Lesson nineteen Modals - Should + infinitive Advice / Duty / Moral obligation. - Ought to You should pay your debts. You should eat more fruit.You ought to respect older people. Drivers ought to be careful while driving. - Had better + bare infinitive Advice. You’d better get new tyres for your car. - Needn’t + infinitive Lack of necessity (in the present). You needn’t knock at the door; I have a key. - Should + have + past participle Past unfulfilled duty / sensible action that was not performed. You should have stopped at the red light. Reproach. I should have been more careful while driving. Regret + perfect infinitive Assumption.- Should + be He left early this morning; he- should have arrived there by now. -should be there by now. • A purpose is normally expressed by an infinitive: a-By a simple infinitive. Ex. He went to Japan to learn Japanese. When there is a personal object of the main verb, the infinitive will refer to this and not to the subject. Ex. He sent his son to Japan to study Japanese . (the son was to study). b-By in order with the infinitive. Ex. She is studying foreign languages in order to qualify for the school of tourism. c-By clauses of purpose. Clauses are necessary when the person to whom the purpose refers is mentioned, instead of being merely understood. Ex. Ships carry lifeboats so that the crew can escape if the ship goes on fire. (the purpose refers to the crew.) • Purpose clauses are usually expressed by: So that + will/would or can/could + infinitive Ex. They wrote the notices in several languages so that foreign tourists could understand them. Can and will are used when the main verb is in a present,present perfect or future tense; could and would are used when the main verb is in a past tense. Ex. I am lighting the fire so that the house will be warm when they come back. I pinned the note to his pillow so that he would be sure to see it. 173Lesson twenty one Expressing Purpose Used to can express : a-A discontinued habit. Ex. She used to sleep a lot when she was pregnant. (She no longer does now). b-A past routine not necessarily discontinued. Ex.It was very hot in the middle of the day and most people used to spend the early afternoon in bed. (They did this when we were there; very likely they still do). •With the interrogative and negative forms used to can be conjugated as an auxiliary or as an ordinary verb (with did). But only the second form is used in spoken English. Ex. Did he use to go on foot? He didn’t use to stay after school. He never used to stay after school. •Not to confuse with the construction ‘to be used to’ which can be used in all tenses followed by a noun or a gerund. Ex. I’m not used to this wet weather . Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. I’m not used to working in such hard conditions. I used to work in a five-star hotel. •Parallel Change is expressed by : The + comparative………..the + comparativeEx. The larger the house, the more money it will cost. The more leisure she has, the happier she is.The better they knew him, the more deceived they become. •Sometimes to be and the subject are omitted Ex. The more, the merrier. The sooner, the better.The less said about it, the better. 174Lesson twenty two Used to + Infinitive Lesson twenty three Parallel Change •Some and Any mean ‘a certain quantity/number’ , and are used before plural or uncountable nouns. They can be pronouns or adjectives. Some is used in affirmative sentences. Ex. I can lend you some books. Any is used: a-In negative sentences. Ex. I haven’t any children and she hasn’t either. b-After hardly, barely, and scarcely (which are almost negative). Ex. I have hardly any cash left. c-After interrogatives. Ex. Have you got any photos of the party? Did you see any of the new collections? •But when the question is really an invitation or a request some is used. Ex. Will you have some tea? Will you carry some of these books for me, please? Some can also be used when the answer ‘yes’ is expected. Ex. I heard a knock; is there someone at the door? d-After if and in expressions of doubt. Ex. If I find any of your letters I’ll send them to you. I doubt whether there is any milk left in the fridge. e-To mean’ practically every’. Ex. Anybody will show you the way (everyone knows it). •Noand none can be used with affirmative verbs to express a negative. They are often an alternative to the negative verb+ any construction. Any can be a pronoun or an adjective, while nois only an adjective and none is always a pronoun. Ex. I haven’t any apples and he hasn’t any. I have no apples and he has none. I did not find any tickets left and he did not find any. I found no tickets left and he found none. • Compounds formed with some , any, and nofollow the same rules mentioned above. Someone somebody something Ex. I know something Anyone anybody anything Ex. Do you know anything? No one nobody nothing Ex. You do not know anything/you know nothing. 175Lesson twenty four Some / Any (past tense/present tense/changing pronouns) When we turn direct speech into indirect or reported speech some changes are necessary whether we are dealing with statements, questions, or commands. However, when the introductory verb (say, tellremark………..) is in the present, present perfect or future, direct statements can be reported withoutany changes of tense. Ex. He says, ‘The train will be late.’ He says the train will be late. (no changes for the tense.) But when the introductory verb is in the past tense, which it usually is, the following tense changes are necessary: He said, ‘Ann willbe in Paris on Monday.’ He said that Ann would be in Paris on Monday. He said, ‘I’ ll be using the car myself.’ He said that he would be using the car himself. ‘I never eatmeat’, he explained. He explained that he never atemeat. • In written English past tenses usually do change to past perfect but there are the following exceptions : a-Past/past continuous tenses used in time clauses do not normally change : Ex. He said, ‘ When we were living/lived in Paris………….’ He said that when they were living/lived in Paris……… . The main verb of such sentences can either remain unchanged or become the past perfect. Ex. He said, ‘ When we were living/lived in Paris we often saw Paul.’ He said that when they were living/lived in Paris they often saw Paul/had often seen Paul. b-A past tense used to describe a state of affairs which still exists when the speech is reported remains unchanged. Ex.She said, ‘I decided not to buy the house because it was on a main road.’ She said that she had decided not to buy the house because it was on a main road. c-Would,should,ought,had better,might,used to,could and must do not normally change: Ex. He said, ‘I might be there.’_______ He said that he might be there. She said, ‘I would help him If I could.’______She said that she would help him if she could. 176Lesson twenty five The reported speech Direct Speech Reported Speech future conditional future continuous conditional continuous simple present simple past present continuous past continuous present perfect past perfect present perfect continuous past perfect continuous d-Conditional sentences type 2 and past tenses (subjunctives) used after wish, would, rather, it is time remain entirely unchanged : Ex. He said,’ If my children were older I would emigrate.’______He said that if his children were older he would emigrate.He said,’ I wish I knew.’_________ He said that he wished he knew.She said,’I’d rather Tom went.’________ She said that she’d rather Tom went. • Other changes necessary when turning direct speech into reported speech: a-In reported speech the conjunction that can be placed immediately after the introductory verb, but it is not essential and is often omitted: Ex. He said,’ I have seen a ghost.’ He said (that) he had seen a ghost. b-Pronouns and possessive adjectives normally change from first or second person to third person except when the speaker is reporting his own words: Ex. I said,’ I like my new house.’ I said that I liked my new house (reporting one’s own words.)He said,’ I’ve forgotten the combination to mysafe.’ He said that hehad forgotten the combination of hissafe. ‘You’ve overcooked the steak again, Mary,’ he said. He told Mary that shehad overcooked the steak again. c-This and These . This used in time expressions usually becomes that: Ex. He said,’ She is coming thisweek.’ He said that she was coming that week. This and that when used as adjectives usually change to the: Ex. He said,’ I bought thispearl/ these pearls for my mother.’ He said that he had bought thepearl(s) for his mother. (more and more / less and less). Gradual Increase is expressed by 2 comparatives joined by “and. Ex. The weather is getting colder and colder. He became more and more self-confident (almost, nearly, quite, just, too ……..) 177Lesson twenty six Gradual Increase /decrease Lesson twenty seven Adverbs of degree a-An adverb of degree modifies an adjective or another adverb. It is placed before the adjective or adverb. Ex. It was toohot to work.. The film was fairly good. I know him quite well. He played extremely badly. b-The infinitive after too, enough . • Too + adjective + infinitive Ex. You are too young to understand .(You do not understand because you are too young). It was too late to do anything. (He could not do anything because it was too late). • Adjective + enough + infinitive Ex. You are old enough to know better. (You should know better at your age). He was intelligent enough to turn off the gas. (He turned off the gas). Not only ........... but also are pairs of conjunctions that are used together to join the members of a parallel structure. The first part of the correlative expression comes before the first member and the second part before the second member. 1 1 2 2 Ex. Henry not only returned the money but also paid interest. 1 1 2 2 Not only the parents but also the children enjoyed the program. 1 1 2 2 She was born not only deaf but also dumb . NB : Correlative conjunction must be followed by the same grammatical structure. 178Lesson twenty eight Not only................. but also NEW WORDS PER LESSON Lesson 1 achieve appreciate care protection resort safety security self-confidentsupport willing Lesson 2 astonished bunch clutch grinknock melt shriek stare step-child step-mum Lesson 3 e-mail incredible intimate keep in touch passwordrenew waitress website Lesson 4 bridge comfort depressed easehopeless lonelysail shine tears weary Lesson 5 appeal chat click desperate fashion hookedmessage mobile needy shy Lesson 6 amaze aquatic breath-taking excursion flight gallery jewellery tripvoyage Lesson 7 fair play teammate league miss gratefuleager career fans look forward to Lesson 8 acquaintance apartment extended family generosity nuclear recover Lesson 9 anger apologizeconflict fight Lesson 10 access contribute deprivation drop out endure estimate hinder labour manufacturing survival trade Lesson 11 come to a head consentfoster house Lesson 12 anarchy calamity corruption decent dignity evil root tyranny Lesson 13 duties forgive peace precious rights Lesson 14 emergency faithful indifferent jealous reliance shameful suspicious tolerant trustworthy Lesson 15 burial field hand hire restless slave trader whipping 179 Lesson 16 empowerment gender equality millenniumoppression promote Lesson 17 diet employee famine malnourished obedience weave Lesson 18 conform to distinguish smart suppress uniform Lesson 19 blankcheck (verb)cope fail Lesson 20 clerk deficit guilty management pick somebody up profit self-sufficient Lesson 21 clinic competitive degree diplomat earn(verb) internship physician stage stitch surgery training Lesson 22deafness drama fed up partially pitch scholarship wonder(verb)worthwhile Lesson 23 depth era expansion explore lifeblood literacy pay tribute shortage Lesson 24 blame casualty decline doubt drop passion release shun track Lesson 25 addict aggressive break up click conceal depression guilt irrational online preoccupied relieve survive Lesson 26 assume bald brains emotions. futuristic obvious substantial Lesson 27 account for(verb) banbill consumption dam damage deforestation. depletion drill drought dump Lesson 28 endanger extinct fumes purify rainfall reduction reverse thinning trap warming wildlife lesson 29 accomplishmentfacility food processor interactivepromotionwitness Lesson 30 compact discdrown lyricsmelody metaphor simile tunes 180 181IRREGULAR VERBS LIST INFINITIVE awake be bearbeat become begin bendbetbitebleedblowbreakbreedbring broadcastbuildburnburstbuycastcatchchooseclingcomecostcreepcut deal digdodrawdreamdrinkdriveeat fallfeed feelfightfindflyforgetforgivefreezegetgivegoSIMPLE PAST awoke was/wereborebeatbecamebeganbentbetbitbledblewbrokebredbroughtbroadcastbuiltburned/burntburstboughtcastcaughtchoseclungcamecostcreptcut dealt dugdiddrewdreamtdrankdrove atefellfedfeltfoughtfoundflewforgotforgavefrozegot gavewentPAST PARTICIPLE awoken beenbornbeatbecomebegunbentbetbittenbledblownbrokenbredbroughtbroadcastbuiltburned/burntburst boughtcastcaughtchosenclungcomecostcreptcutdealtdugdonedrawn dreamtdrunkdriveneatenfallenfedfeltfoughtfoundflownforgottenforgivenfrozengotgiven gone 182INFINITIVE grow hanghavehearhidehitholdhurtkeepknowlayleadlearnleavelendletlielightlosemakemeanmeetmistakepayputreadrideringriserunsay seeseeksellsendsetshake shineshootshowshrinkshutsingsinksitsleepspeakspeedSIMPLE PAST grew hunghadheardhidhitheldhurt kept knewlaidled learntleftlentletlaylitlostmademeantmetmistookpaidputreadrode rangroseransaidsawsoughtsoldsentsetshookshoneshotshowedshrankshutsangsanksat sleptspokespedPAST PARTICIPLE grown hunghadheardhiddenhitheldhurtkeptknownlaidledlearntleftlentletlainlitlostmademeantmetmistakenpaidputread riddenrungrisenrunsaidseensoughtsoldsentsetshakenshoneshotshownshrunkshutsungsunksatsleptspokensped 183INFINITIVE spell spendspoilspreadstand stealstickstrikeswearsweepswimtaketeachtellthinkunderstandwakewearweavewinwrite SIMPLE PAST spelt spentspoiled/spoiltspreadstoodstolestuckstrucksworesweptswamtooktaughttoldthoughtunderstood wokeworewovewonwrotePAST PARTICIPLE spelt spentspoiled/spoiltspreadstoodstolenstuckstruckswornsweptswumtakentaughttoldthoughtunderstoodwoken wornwovenwonwritten Short Vowel Sounds: Red box b us c at river book s ixPHONETIC SYMBOLS 184Long vowel sounds : Three moon g irl c ar moree i: here ei ght p oor boy throw there mynow eIeI ai aI Diphthongs : Triphthongs : / f ire / flowera::cIc e u::e Consonants : p k b d d1 g f θ s ∫ v a z 1 m n n h l r w jt t∫Ieeau ΩeΩ Ωe aae^ eΩa pen ten tea cher kick ball doll an gel god fine three stop pu sh voice this zero mea sure monday night ki ng h ello listen read white yes e"

3Perform through English’ is an attempt at implementing the Tunisian
syllabus. The present provisional edition of the book is meant to betried out, assessed by all parties involved and eventually amended.
The basic assumptions underlying the making of the book are the 
following :
• The learner’s role is paramount. He / she is the main actor in constructing
meaning. Hence the autonomy he / she’s expected to demonstrate while learning.
• The learners’ immediate environment, the classroom, is viewed as a valid
context for communicating and sharing.
• Learning is a matter of give and take. It involves hypothesising, negotiating
and checking.
• Language is seen as a means of communication with self and others. It is
also presented as a subject matter requiring specific study skills and strategies.
• The ultimate purpose of learning a language is to acquire the skills which will enable the learner to construct meaning and interact with others.
Hence the important role given in the book to authenticity of language andactivities on the one hand and to context on the other hand.
The main features of ‘Perform through English’ can be summarized as
follows :
• The skills targeted are to be developed through content and direct 
instruction.• Each lesson is geared to fostering some components of the above 
mentioned skills.
• The emphasis laid on skills does not mean that skills are neglected. Indeed, the two aspects go hand in hand. The large range of 
texts and activities is meant to develop the four language skills (reading, listening, speaking and writing) in a naturally integrated way.The book is composed of a book map, a series of 35 lessons and an appendix.PREFACE
4The book map provides a detailed inventory of the titles of the lessons, the
competency components as well as the targeted functions and language items (vocabulary and grammar).
As a rule, the lessons open with a ‘Getting Started’ activity meant to pave
the way for the remaining activities of the lesson and the targetedcompetencies. Some of the lessons may require more than one teachingsession. We believe it is the teacher’s responsibility to decide how much timeeach lesson should take.
As for the appendix (grammar summary, targeted functions, spelling
notes, table of phonetic symbols and word list), it is meant to be used on aregular basis by the learners themselves even when the lesson is under way.We believe that this can enhance the learners’ study skills.
Although the authors do not share the idea that the syllabus is the teacher,
they strongly believe that the teacher’s contribution does make thedifference when it comes to achieving goals.

2.Read the text and check your guess.
Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in Italy. In 1894, she qualified as a doctor
and seven years later, she set up a school in Rome. In 1922, she was madeinspector of schools by the Italian government and she started writing and lectu-ring about education. She died in 1953 at the age of 82. A person may knowa lot about the rulesof sewing but hecan’t . Similarly, a personwho may not beable to use that lan-guage.
21Ibn Khuldun wrote about society and about langua-ge. Concerning the latter, he said that knowing alanguage is not knowing the rules of grammar. Hegave the example of someone who knows aboutsewing. This person says: “First, you push a pieceof thread through the eye of a needle, then youpush the needle through a piece of cloth. When twopieces are joined, you repeat the process, puttingthe needle some distance in front…” However, IbnKhuldun asks: “Do you ask this person to make youa coat or do you ask a tailor? Does knowing therules mean you can do something?”
play – game – toy – picture – painting – happiness – bright colours 

LESSON 10
45Nowadays, we are used to seeing young children ""learn through play"" in infants
schools and kindergartens. This is partly thanks to Maria Montessori. Childrenthere play with brightly coloured toys. They are encouraged to paint and draw andtheir paintings are pinned on the wall. They are also encouraged to discover thingsfor themselves.
But schools were not like that before Maria Montessori's times. Learners were
seated in black uncomfortable desks arranged in fixed rows. They had to learn les-sons by heart. Corporal punishment was quite common and if a child made thetiniest mistake, he was smacked or flogged on the spot!
Maria Montessori actually started a revolution in education. She liked to work
with neglected children and those who had difficulties of any kind. Of course a lotof people didn't approve of Montessori's ideas. They believed her method could notwork but she insisted that if you showed children respect, understanding and kind-ness, they could learn better. She also believed that if children are happy and inter-ested, they could get good results at school. Frightening teachers and boring les-sons did not help at all.
3. Are the following statements true or false? Justify your answers with details
from the text.
a) Maria Montessori became a doctor when she was 24 years old.
b) She started a school in 1901.c) It didn't take her long to be recognized as an important educationist.

ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE
In three months, in the summer of 1943, I suddenly grew up.
The beginning was like this: Dad wrote to me to come to America. I got a brand
new suit made. I said to myself: “On the boat, I am going to meet a beautiful girl,and I am going to fall in love.” So, I got on the boat. The first day, I sat on the deckand read an interesting book. On the second day, I found out who were the otherpassengers on the boat. The third day, I was not interested in the book any lon-ger. The fourth day, I was up to my neck in the trouble I was looking for.
It was a ten-day boat. I would rather spend two years in hospital than go
through that experience again.
When I first met her, I thought she was not older than me. In fact, she was twice
my age, but you can be twice 16 without being old. She was small and delicate.Her skin looked like porcelain. But she had big wide eyes and was not afraid totalk.
We talked. She told me about her family, her job. She told me about a famous
person and a prince who wanted to marry her. Three days later, I made a decla-ration of my undying love. I said: “I cannot, I will not love anyone but you. If yougo to the ends of the earth, I will join you there.” She talked to me in her turn, gent-ly and sweetly. She said: “This can never be.

57ARE NEIGHBOURS NECESSARY?
ACTIVITY 1: GETTING STARTED
Jot down notes on your notebook to answer the following questions:
1. Is it necessary to, have good neighbours?
2.What does a good neighbour mean to you?
ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE
Nowadays a good neighbour has been replaced by modern means of commu-
nication and entertainment. But in those days, a good neighbour meant somethingcompletely different. 
A good neighbour knew everything about you and liked you, too. He never let
you down. When you were in trouble, he came to your rescue. If one of the familywas sick in the night, he sat up until the doctor came. Sometimes he sent for thedoctor himself. 
The Bouldrys were that
kind of neighbours. Lem Bouldry was a good farmer.
Mrs. Bouldry had a maid and Lem had two men the year round. They even had apiano. Mrs Bouldry changed her dress every afternoon and they kept their houseclean and tidy. Even their lawn was well kept because they mowed it regularly. 
But the Covells were just the opposite. I could never understand how my father
got along with them. Mr. Covell was ten years younger than my father. However,everybody called him ’Old Covell’. His face and hands were like sole leather. If hishair was ever washed, it was when he was caught in a rainstorm. My father usedto say:” Covell is always borrowing things. He might borrow the shirt off your backthen bring it back six months later to have it mended.” My mother would say:"" I'msure he would never  bring it back to have it washed.”
When Mrs Covell was seriously ill last year, Mrs Bouldry took care of her; took
care of the rest of the children too —four of them. She stayed in the Covell  housemost of the time and went home only for a short nap (a little sleep) now and then.She had to do that because there was not an extra sheet in that house or an extrabed. Mrs Bouldry was not afraid to use her hands —she did all the Covells’ was-hing herself.
But even ’Old Covell’, despite his unusual character, was a good neighbour…
LESSON 14

tements are true.
a) Good neighbours know about each other’s lives.

of the statements in the first activity.
He is among the most successful authors of our time, his thrillers becoming
bestsellers as soon as they are published . Six of his novels have been made into
films featuring such famous stars like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts.
Yet multi-millionaire John Grisham, 47, still has his feet firmly on the ground: he
would rather be playing baseball with his kids than attending parties.
As a child, John dreamed of being a professional baseball player but he wasn't
good enough. So he studied lawand became a lawyer , working 70 hours a week
and trying to squeeze in time to write novels.
He specialised in criminal defence and one day he heard the horrifying testi-
mony of a 12-year-old girl. Her story inspired him to start a novel 
After three years, he finished the novel A Time To Kill. It was rejected by 28
publishers . Now they must wish they'd agreed to give the lawyer-turned-writer a
chance.
Since then, he has written one novel a year. All of them have been bestsellers.
There are currently more than 60 million John Grisham books in print worldwide,
translated into 29 languages.
LESSON 15
60So, what's the secret of success? ""Turning pages,"" he says. ""You must have a
story that makes the reader turn the pages. The plot has to be intelligent and you
need interesting characters , so that your readers care about them. What I'm trying
to do is just write good popular fiction ."" 
His life is no longer the struggle it was when he first started out in his legal
career. He now earns £28 million a year and lives quietly with his wife Renee andtheir two children.

According to a report on education, computers will soon be taking over
from schoolteachers. 
Greater use of PCs in the classroom will offer pupils ""exciting new ways to
personalise their learning"". 
Instead of going on field trips they will take virtual tours. If they've got any
questions, they will be able to access chatrooms or e-mail online teacherswho will have been ""liberated from their traditional role as the fount of all kno-wledge"". 
Children will be encouraged to ""adapt the programme to their individual
needs"" and ""learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own envi-ronment"". 
Education authorities welcomed this ""excellent document"" which would
""improve the quality of learning"" and end teacher shortages at the same time.

will be able to = ability in the futureDear Sir,
I'm all for the age of information technology and the Internet. Besides, my
own children who are now quite skilled at using a computer have actuallyderived many benefits from it. But I really wish the authorities were concer-ned with making the pupils computer literate as much as making them litera-te in the traditional sense.
Some modern teenagers can surf the World Wide Web at the speed of
light. Others can  reprogram a stolen mobile phone with the aid of a laptop.However, fewer and fewer of them seem able to write a formal letter or eventheir own name.
If you allow them “to personalise their learning experience”, they'll imme-
diately log on to the nearest games website and fall in love  with a Red Indianin Kansas. 
If you let them “work at their own pace and in their own environment”,
they'll end up spending all day hanging around, smoking and wasting theirtime. 
What modern teenagers need is discipline. Computers may provide education but they cannot maintain discipline.
John Brown.

ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE
1.Read the following story and find out if it matches your opinions about pen 
friends. Justify your answer.
The year was 1946. It was a time when no one had any money. There was noescape, except in your mind. So when I saw the appeal for pen friends, I wrote areply. I waited and waited, checking the post daily. Several weeks passed. Then,one day, a letter arrived. It was from America and the envelope had a nice stamp.It was so exciting. I tore it open and started to read.
Helen told me about her family and friends. The war was over and life in Britain
was sad. In contrast, America was the land of milk and honey. When I   finishedreading I picked up a pen and started to write back
We became regular pen pals. I told her about the factory where I worked and we
wrote about boy-friends and dances. Helen's letters became the highlight of myweek. My family would gather round while I read out her news. We were thousandsof miles apart but she felt like a best friend. In time, we both married and weexchanged photos. More years passed and wedding photos progressed to babyA FRIEND I COULD NEVER FORGET

LESSON 19
72pics. We compared notes on motherhood and described
our growing families. Some weeks I didn't find the time towrite, but Helen's letters arrived without fail. Old Faithful,my mum called her. We'd been writing so long she was oneof the family. More years passed. Our children grew up andbefore we knew it, Helen and I were swapping photos of ourgrandchildren.
“Can you believe that we've been writing for 38 years?” I
wrote. “Where has all the time gone?”In that time Helen andI had exchanged hundreds of letters but had never spoken on the phone, let alonemet. I had an idea and put it to my husband Dennis. I picked up my pen and wrote:“I've done it at last! “A few weeks later I boarded a plane and, seven hours later we landed down inAmerica. I was shaking with nerves and excitement as I went through customs. Iscanned the sea of expectant faces and one woman gave me a big smile. “Violet?”she said. “Helen?” I replied. Together we chorused “I can't believe it!'” We huggedeach other then Helen led me to the car and we set off for her home. Along the waywe chatted nonstop. Helen was every bit as warm as her letters. We arrived and her husband John held out his arms to me. “Welcome to your newhome,” he said. And it did feel like home. Helen and I didn’t stop talking. She taughtme how to can tomatoes and I cooked her a roast with Yorkshire pudding. Wespent whole afternoons in fits of laughter. “It's like meeting a sister,'” Helen said. One week became two, then three. There was so much to do I barely thought abouthome. Then Dennis called. In the background I could hear my grandsons playing.All of a sudden a wave of homesickness swept over me. I replaced the receiver,turned to Helen and said: “It's time to go home.”Helen drove me to the airport and we kissed goodbye.  I'd only been home a weekbefore a letter arrived.The letters continued to flow and I looked forward to the day when I could show
Helen my family. Christmas arrived and I wrote a card to her. Maybe this year...
When I didn't receive a card from Helen I assumed it was delayed in the post. ButJanuary arrived and there was still no word. Finally a letter came. I tore it open. I'mafraid I've got some sad news. It was from John. For 50 years Helen and I were part of each other's lives and every time the postarrives I think of her.  I'm so glad we managed to meet. 

732.Read the following questions then re-read the story and jot down notes:
a) Why did Violet answer the call for pen friends?b) Did she wait long before she got a letter?c) Who sent it? What did she write in it?d) Was that the end of a short correspondence?e) Who and what did the friends write about in their letters?f) What was surprising in their attitude?

b) check your prediction against the text
WE BUILT IT OURSELVES
For most people, the price of an ideal house is too high. They just can’t afford it.
But some couples solved the problem by building their homes themselves.
Before building their home, the Thorleys were living in a tiny flat, but earlier they
had lived in a small cottage. They wanted to move to a home with more room
and
a bigger garden for their children. It was Dammi who had the idea of self-building.He is good at Do-It-Yourself and works for a building company. He also had theskills to do lots of work himself.
First, the Theorleys wanted to buy a new house but it was beyond their price
range. Then they decided to buy a plot. It was part of a garden of a big house ona hill with a beautiful view. Just what they wanted! They sold their house and gota loan from their bank.1To do something oneselfTo have something done (by someone else)myselfourselvesyourself - yourselveshimselfherselfitselfthemselves
own – proper – large – flat
77The first foundations were laid in 1999 and every weekend and spare time was
spent on the house . During the build, they saved as much as they could. Apart
from employing bricklayers, roof tilers, a plumber and an electrician, they did eve-rything else, with family and friends’ help.
Five months later, the house was ready. The upstairs consists of four bedrooms
and two bathrooms. On the ground floor, the entrance leads to a dining room.There’s also a kitchen with a breakfast area and a lounge. The floors and stairca-se are in wood.
When the house was finished, they did the decorating themselves. Now, they
are pleased with the result. Mrs Thorley said: “If we didn’t do it
ourselves, we
wouldn’t have such a nice house now. Building a house of our own was a dream.But now we have achieved it.”
2.What is meant by the words underlined in the text? Tick the right alternative.
3. Why did the Theorleys need a new house?
4.What made it easier for Mr Theorley to build the house himself? Give two 
reasons.
5.Where did they get the money to build the house? Complete the sentences in

6.Which 4 things couldn’t Mr. Theorley do himself?
7.Draw the plan of the new house on your notebook. What is tested is your
reading comprehension skill, not your drawing skill.
8.How do the Theorleys feel about their achievement?321– space
a) ‘Room’ means here – a part of a house

3. Arabic is not mentioned in the text. Write a 3-line paragraph about it. Follow 
the model in the text.
4.Now, make up your mind and report to the class what language you’ll
choose for next year and why.SO, WHAT’S EASIEST TO LEARN?
• Spanish and Italian are the easiest to master at basic level. The vocabulary
mirrors structures in English and is easy to . German is in the same language family as English, so feels familiar. 
French : Plenty of familiar , but the pronunciation can be difficult for
English .
Portuguese : The follows Latin structures, but pronunciation is very different
and can be difficult.Hungarian : Tricky pronunciation and usual structure.
Chinese means a new alphabet and lots and lots to .
Japanese has a different alphabet.
Russian also has a different alphabet and an unfamiliar .
People find it easier to learn a language in the same language ‘family’ as their
own. English has elements of both Germanic (German, Danish, Dutch) andLatin (Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese) languages, so English speakersare well placed to learn any of these. Italians could easily learn Spanish.Japanese and grammar are hard, but pronunciation isn’t, while Chinese pro-nunciation is very difficult for Europeans

•I’m sorry you have such difficult times with your mum. She probably thinks that
you expect too much freedom and that you are too young for that. Think aboutit: when she was your age, she wasn’t given much freedom by her own mum.Then she doesn’t know how to give you the space you need. She cannot treatyou like an equal.
If you can, sit down with your mum and tell her exactly what you told me.
Do it politely and calmly. When she sees how responsible and mature youare, she’ll probably give you more freedom.

An X-ray Reveals why Pru was Poorly
Curiosity rarely seems to do a cat muchgood. In Pru's case, it opened the door to aserious case of indigestion. The six-monthold cat, who has a habit of being naughty,swallowed a key. When her worried ownertook her to the vet four days later becauseshe was a bit off-colour, an X-ray quickly pin-pointed the exact location of the problem. The key, over an inch long, was lodgedtightly in her stomach. “She is into everything,” her owner Pat Huntley said. “Youcan’t open a cupboard door without her being there. The key was lying on mybedroom windowsill. She must have seen it, thought it looked nice and startedplaying with it, tossed it up in the air and swallowed it. I couldn't believe it when thevet phoned to say that they were going to have to do majorsurgery because Pru had a key in her.” Vet Elizabeth Day,who carried out the operation said: “When the nurse wasdeveloping the X-ray in the darkroom, I heard her screamwhen she saw the key,” she said. “I have been a vet for 13years and I have never had to take anything like this out ofa cat. They are usually quite choosy about what they eat.The key probably wasn't causing her any pain but if it hadpassed into her intestine it could have caused more seve-re problems”. After a couple of days recovering, Pru isalready bouncing back. Mrs. Huntley said: “I have goneround the house and put away anything that might looktempting to her.”

f) What did the pet have to undergo before that?g) How did the nurse find out about what was wrong with the pet?h) How did she feel? Justify your answer.i) Was the pet saved in time? Why?j) How long did it take the pet to recover?k) What lesson did the owner learn?l) What does the story tell us about how the British treat  their pets?m) How far would you go yourself?
3.Tick the right alternative.
a) The text probably appeared in
– a newspaper;– an encyclopaedia– a biology book.
b) The purpose of the writer is
– to report a serious problem;– to entertain the reader;– to show how clever cats are.
c) The phrase on sentence that best illustrates the story is

So you Want to be a TV Presenter?
There’s no qualification that will guarantee you a job in TV. A-levels in Drama, performing
Arts, English and Media are useful as they give you experience.Let’s say that famous presenters don’t probably have too many cash flow probs. Beinga presenter on a local or small cable channel is a different matter though!Attraction could be your passport to fame.Lots of waiting around on sets, it’s a stressful job and the hours can be long.Lots of people want to be TV presenters and a small number of them make it. Getused to being in front of a video camera and get some work experience.Go for it if you’re confident, a good communicator and ready to work your way upfrom the bottom.Not for you if you’re shy and you want job security.

was planning to marry his girlfriend Jessica later in the year. Then suddenly hestarted to have problems with his eyes. He had a rare disease and, despite aIl thetreatment, he was totally blind in 6 months. He thought his life was finished. Firsthe told Jessica to leave him and to marry someone that could see. She refusedand insisted they got married. Then he informed his company that he was blindand he offered to resign. They refused and instead arranged for him to attend aspecial retraining college.
At the college, Brian learnt new skills. He learnt to read Braille. He also learnt
to use a computer with Braille keys, so that if Brian keys in Braille, the computerprints ordinary script or he can use his voice to produce script. He learnt how toorganise his life at home, how to cook safely and how to keep his clothes tidy. Healways buys the same coloured socks. Finally, he was given his guide dog. Helearnt to give Rover special commands and to follow Rover as he led Brian acrossbusy roads and through the traffic. Brian then realised that guide dogs are allowedon buses; trains; in offices and even in some restaurants because these dogs havespecial rights 
At first Brian’s colleagues were very curious to have a blind colleague and a
dog in the office but now people hardly notice. Clients who only communicate withBrian through email or on the phone do not even realise he has any disability. Onehundred years ago, Brian's illness would have resulted in him losing his job andperhaps being on the streets begging. Today our human rights state there shouldbe equality in the workplace for aIl our citizens.

ACTIVITY 2 : READING COMPREHENSION
1. Read through the text and find out what an au pair girl is.
Sandra, 38, has two children, Ariella, three, and Eliana, 10 weeks. They live in

Valentina Pezzano, 17, lives in Livorno, a
town near Pisa, Italy. She's the only child ofFabiana, 43, and Ivo, 50, who's an Italiannaval officer. She loved her home, herfriends and Conny, her pet rabbit —but shewanted to travel and learn other languages.‘I have no sisters or brothers, so my mothermisses me, and that makes me sad. But myparents want what's best for me. They knowit's important for me to travel and speakforeign languages,’ she says. ‘A friend ofmine gave me the address of an au pairagency and I wrote to them. A few dayslater, Sandra, my present employer, rangmy parents. I couldn't believe it. I was soexcited, I punched the air,’ she laughs. ‘Myparents and friends all came to the airport. Icried with my mother, but it was lovely theywere there. I talk to them on the phoneevery week.’
99Ariella. I applied for another au pair, but this
time I was more careful. There was somethingabout Valentina’s application letter that touchedme. She told me all about herself, her family,even her rabbit. I just knew she'd be right for us.And she is. She's not just an au pair, she's morelike a friend.’
Valentina's day begins at 7.45am, with
breakfast for her and the two children. She does-n't do their washing and ironing, but looks afterthem with affection. She also helps with the clea-ning. We do it together and have a lot of laughs—she's good company.’ says Sandra. ‘I don'tmind the housework because it's my home, too,for the next six months,’ says Valentina. Alreadyher stay is becoming a two-way project —reci-pes are being swapped, ‘Her pasta sauces arewonderful,’ says Sandra. ‘Also, Valentina'sEnglish is improving daily. 'I'll register her at thelocal college next month and she's promised toteach me Italian,’ says Sandra.
Valentina gets £40 a week, free meals and accommodation. She has weekends off
and spends them visiting British sights, such as Portobello Road and the NationalGallery but she isn't impressed by London's ancient buildings —‘We do haveFlorence!’ she says. She isn’t impressed by Oxford Street, either: ‘It reminds me ofhome. We have lots of markets in Italy, but the clothes are cheaper. Using London'sTube is easy for me but I'm scared of the traffic as the cars drive on the other sidehere! What I'm really interested in is the difference in thinking and English humour.

When I started teaching, I was a young man with a lot of energy. I thought l was
prepared for everything. But I was not prepared to face a room full of
teenagers.
They entered the school at the age of I5 and remained with
the same teachers until they were I8. They had their own les-
sons in English, maths, history and computer science.
However they attended normal lessons for two or three per-
iods a day. The pupils had to respect some strict rules while
the teachers gave them extra attention. We believed in
those pupils and they usually made a good effort and obtai-
ned excellent results. 
Raul was one of those pupils. When I first met him, he was
16, older than most of the other students in his class. He was
short, skinny and always hungry .But he worked hard and improved
his maths from poor to fair to excellent.who

condition: he had to repay the full sum .But he couldn't pay me back until he gra-duated.
During the past two years, he wanted to leave school many times. But he
remembered his promise and, as he couldn't afford to pay his debt back, he remai-ned at school.
On graduation day, the principal called his name, but he wasn’t there. I was
going to get his diploma in his place when I heard a familiar voice. “Here I am,” Raulsaid “I’m sorry I am late. I had to go back home and get my graduation hat.” I wasrelieved. “That's O.K, Raul” I said. ""And now here is your money,” he said handingme an envelope “I owe a lot more than money.

Mideterranean sun. The dog and his owner, Pascal Brockley, were having a greattime on their summer holiday in…
But as they were enjoying the sun, they saw three people panicking at the sea.
The tourists had ignored the red warning flags and swam into the deep water. Butthe sea was too strong and they
were soon caught in the water. They were unable
to get back to the shore. They felt so happy. They were crying for help.
Pascal’s friend Bruno, who was surfing near the shore, saw the swimmers , too.
He realised they were in danger and set off to help them. Both Maui and Pascalwere trained life savers and didn’t think twice about helping. They didn’t think abouttheir safety. They just thought of saving the lives of others
.
Maui swam to the drowning swimmers. With the help of Bruno and Pascal, he
pulled the two people back to the shore. He didn’t stop to rest and swam back to
rescue the last person . Pascal followed his trusty pet . The pair fought the waves
to reach the swimmer. By now, Maui was exhausted. The powerful waves were toomuch for the brave dog. He slipped under the waves and when Pascal wanted torescue him
, it was too late.
Maui was dead. Pascal was very upset. His beautiful heroic pet was dead. He
sat down and looked across the beach. He was sad but what he saw made himangry: the three
people were running away. Maui gave his life to save those stran-

THE ENVIRONMENT DOES MATTER
117ACTIVITY 1 : GETTING THE MESSAGE
1.Read the question of the text below and try to give a personal answer.
Question: What's more important than good schools and safe streets? More
important, even, than decent hospitals and health services?
Answer: The planet we live on. Without that, nothing else counts . The future of the
planet now rests in  the hands of the world's leaders. If they get it wrong, there'll be no
need to worry about anything else. You need only to look at the weather to know some-
thing odd is happening. It's called global warming. It's what happens when greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide build up and act like a thermal blanket around the world.As we pump more of them into the air by burning coal, oil and gas, this blanket thickensand the world warms up
. It'll mean more freak weather, flooding and drought. The sea
level is likely to rise by at least three feet. That doesn't sound much, but it's enough to
swamp many cities and towns around the world. 
And that's not all. Some experts believe that we have been seriously underestimating
how fast global warming will happen. They think that by the time today's newborn babiesare 50 years old, we could have set in motion a catastrophic chain of events that willleave much of the planet a desert. They predict a future in which our children see rain-forests burst into flame and seas boil -unless we act today.

The present provisional edition of the book is meant to betried out, assessed by all parties involved and eventually amended. The basic assumptions underlying the making of the book are the following : • The learner’s role is paramount. He / she is the main actor in constructing meaning. Hence the autonomy he / she’s expected to demonstrate while learning. • The learners’ immediate environment, the classroom, is viewed as a valid context for communicating and sharing. • Learning is a matter of give and take. It involves hypothesising, negotiating and checking. • Language is seen as a means of communication with self and others. It is also presented as a subject matter requiring specific study skills and strategies. • The ultimate purpose of learning a language is to acquire the skills which will enable the learner to construct meaning and interact with others. Hence the important role given in the book to authenticity of language andactivities on the one hand and to context on the other hand. The main features of ‘Perform through English’ can be summarized as follows : • The skills targeted are to be developed through content and direct instruction.• Each lesson is geared to fostering some components of the above mentioned skills. • The emphasis laid on skills does not mean that skills are neglected. Indeed, the two aspects go hand in hand. The large range of texts and activities is meant to develop the four language skills (reading, listening, speaking and writing) in a naturally integrated way.The book is composed of a book map, a series of 35 lessons and an appendix.PREFACE 4The book map provides a detailed inventory of the titles of the lessons, the competency components as well as the targeted functions and language items (vocabulary and grammar). As a rule, the lessons open with a ‘Getting Started’ activity meant to pave the way for the remaining activities of the lesson and the targetedcompetencies. Some of the lessons may require more than one teachingsession. We believe it is the teacher’s responsibility to decide how much timeeach lesson should take. As for the appendix (grammar summary, targeted functions, spelling notes, table of phonetic symbols and word list), it is meant to be used on aregular basis by the learners themselves even when the lesson is under way.We believe that this can enhance the learners’ study skills. Although the authors do not share the idea that the syllabus is the teacher, they strongly believe that the teacher’s contribution does make thedifference when it comes to achieving goals.

Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in Italy. In 1894, she qualified as a doctor and seven years later, she set up a school in Rome. In 1922, she was madeinspector of schools by the Italian government and she started writing and lectu-ring about education. She died in 1953 at the age of 82. A person may knowa lot about the rulesof sewing but hecan’t . Similarly, a personwho may not beable to use that lan-guage. 21Ibn Khuldun wrote about society and about langua-ge. Concerning the latter, he said that knowing alanguage is not knowing the rules of grammar. Hegave the example of someone who knows aboutsewing. This person says: “First, you push a pieceof thread through the eye of a needle, then youpush the needle through a piece of cloth. When twopieces are joined, you repeat the process, puttingthe needle some distance in front…” However, IbnKhuldun asks: “Do you ask this person to make youa coat or do you ask a tailor? Does knowing therules mean you can do something?” play – game – toy – picture – painting – happiness – bright colours LESSON 10 45Nowadays, we are used to seeing young children ""learn through play"" in infants schools and kindergartens. This is partly thanks to Maria Montessori. Childrenthere play with brightly coloured toys. They are encouraged to paint and draw andtheir paintings are pinned on the wall. They are also encouraged to discover thingsfor themselves. But schools were not like that before Maria Montessori's times. Learners were seated in black uncomfortable desks arranged in fixed rows. They had to learn les-sons by heart. Corporal punishment was quite common and if a child made thetiniest mistake, he was smacked or flogged on the spot! Maria Montessori actually started a revolution in education. She liked to work with neglected children and those who had difficulties of any kind. Of course a lotof people didn't approve of Montessori's ideas. They believed her method could notwork but she insisted that if you showed children respect, understanding and kind-ness, they could learn better. She also believed that if children are happy and inter-ested, they could get good results at school. Frightening teachers and boring les-sons did not help at all. 3. Are the following statements true or false?

ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE In three months, in the summer of 1943, I suddenly grew up. The beginning was like this: Dad wrote to me to come to America. I got a brand new suit made. I said to myself: “On the boat, I am going to meet a beautiful girl,and I am going to fall in love.” So, I got on the boat. The first day, I sat on the deckand read an interesting book. On the second day, I found out who were the otherpassengers on the boat. The third day, I was not interested in the book any lon-ger. The fourth day, I was up to my neck in the trouble I was looking for. It was a ten-day boat. I would rather spend two years in hospital than go through that experience again. When I first met her, I thought she was not older than me. In fact, she was twice my age, but you can be twice 16 without being old. She was small and delicate.Her skin looked like porcelain. But she had big wide eyes and was not afraid totalk. We talked. She told me about her family, her job. She told me about a famous person and a prince who wanted to marry her. Three days later, I made a decla-ration of my undying love. I said: “I cannot, I will not love anyone but you. If yougo to the ends of the earth, I will join you there.” She talked to me in her turn, gent-ly and sweetly. She said: “This can never be. We shall never meet again.” But shemeant “You are a nice boy but please grow up before someone makes a fool ofyou.” I went to my cabin and cried over my diary for a while and then, against all the laws of romance, I fell asleep.LOVE BOAT Kaïs – Cleopatra – Juliet – Antar – Hamlet – Khaoula – Leila – Virginia – Romeo – Tarafah – Ophelia – Paul – Antony – Abla LESSON 12 511.Read the text and say how it relates to the people mentioned in question 1. 2.Focus on the first part of the text and answer the following questions: a) How old was the writer?b) Was he independent? c) What was unusual about him? 3.What is meant by a) “… the trouble I was looking for”?b) “ … a ten day boat”? 4.Pick out a sentence showing how serious this trouble was. 5.

ACTIVITY 1: GETTING STARTED Jot down notes on your notebook to answer the following questions: 1. Is it necessary to, have good neighbours? 2.What does a good neighbour mean to you? ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE Nowadays a good neighbour has been replaced by modern means of commu- nication and entertainment. But in those days, a good neighbour meant somethingcompletely different. A good neighbour knew everything about you and liked you, too. He never let you down. When you were in trouble, he came to your rescue. If one of the familywas sick in the night, he sat up until the doctor came. Sometimes he sent for thedoctor himself. The Bouldrys were that kind of neighbours. Lem Bouldry was a good farmer. Mrs. Bouldry had a maid and Lem had two men the year round. They even had apiano. Mrs Bouldry changed her dress every afternoon and they kept their houseclean and tidy. Even their lawn was well kept because they mowed it regularly. But the Covells were just the opposite. I could never understand how my father got along with them. Mr. Covell was ten years younger than my father. However,everybody called him ’Old Covell’. His face and hands were like sole leather. If hishair was ever washed, it was when he was caught in a rainstorm. My father usedto say:” Covell is always borrowing things. He might borrow the shirt off your backthen bring it back six months later to have it mended.” My mother would say:"" I'msure he would never bring it back to have it washed.” When Mrs Covell was seriously ill last year, Mrs Bouldry took care of her; took care of the rest of the children too —four of them.

Read through the text and find out if John Grisham’s example supports any of the statements in the first activity. He is among the most successful authors of our time, his thrillers becoming bestsellers as soon as they are published . Six of his novels have been made into films featuring such famous stars like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts. Yet multi-millionaire John Grisham, 47, still has his feet firmly on the ground: he would rather be playing baseball with his kids than attending parties. As a child, John dreamed of being a professional baseball player but he wasn't good enough. So he studied lawand became a lawyer , working 70 hours a week and trying to squeeze in time to write novels. He specialised in criminal defence and one day he heard the horrifying testi- mony of a 12-year-old girl. Her story inspired him to start a novel After three years, he finished the novel A Time To Kill. It was rejected by 28 publishers . Now they must wish they'd agreed to give the lawyer-turned-writer a chance. Since then, he has written one novel a year. All of them have been bestsellers. There are currently more than 60 million John Grisham books in print worldwide, translated into 29 languages. LESSON 15 60So, what's the secret of success? ""Turning pages,"" he says. ""You must have a story that makes the reader turn the pages. The plot has to be intelligent and you need interesting characters , so that your readers care about them. What I'm trying to do is just write good popular fiction ."" His life is no longer the struggle it was when he first started out in his legal career. He now earns £28 million a year and lives quietly with his wife Renee andtheir two children. 2.What were John Grisham’s two major occupations?

Instead of going on field trips they will take virtual tours. If they've got any questions, they will be able to access chatrooms or e-mail online teacherswho will have been ""liberated from their traditional role as the fount of all kno-wledge"". Children will be encouraged to ""adapt the programme to their individual needs"" and ""learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own envi-ronment"".

Subject +was / were able to = ability in the past am / is / are able to = ability in the present will be able to = ability in the futureDear Sir, I'm all for the age of information technology and the Internet. Besides, my own children who are now quite skilled at using a computer have actuallyderived many benefits from it. But I really wish the authorities were concer-ned with making the pupils computer literate as much as making them litera-te in the traditional sense. Some modern teenagers can surf the World Wide Web at the speed of light. Others can reprogram a stolen mobile phone with the aid of a laptop.However, fewer and fewer of them seem able to write a formal letter or eventheir own name. If you allow them “to personalise their learning experience”, they'll imme- diately log on to the nearest games website and fall in love with a Red Indianin Kansas. If you let them “work at their own pace and in their own environment”, they'll end up spending all day hanging around, smoking and wasting theirtime. What modern teenagers need is discipline. Computers may provide education but they cannot maintain discipline. John Brown. 19LESSON 19 71ACTIVITY 1: GETTING STARTED Answer the following questions: 1.

ACTIVITY 2: GETTING THE MESSAGE 1.Read the following story and find out if it matches your opinions about pen friends. Justify your answer. The year was 1946. It was a time when no one had any money. There was noescape, except in your mind. So when I saw the appeal for pen friends, I wrote areply. I waited and waited, checking the post daily. Several weeks passed. Then,one day, a letter arrived. It was from America and the envelope had a nice stamp.It was so exciting. I tore it open and started to read. Helen told me about her family and friends. The war was over and life in Britain was sad. In contrast, America was the land of milk and honey. When I finishedreading I picked up a pen and started to write back We became regular pen pals. I told her about the factory where I worked and we wrote about boy-friends and dances. Helen's letters became the highlight of myweek. My family would gather round while I read out her news. We were thousandsof miles apart but she felt like a best friend. In time, we both married and weexchanged photos. More years passed and wedding photos progressed to babyA FRIEND I COULD NEVER FORGET LESSON 19 72pics. We compared notes on motherhood and described our growing families. Some weeks I didn't find the time towrite, but Helen's letters arrived without fail. Old Faithful,my mum called her. We'd been writing so long she was oneof the family. More years passed. Our children grew up andbefore we knew it, Helen and I were swapping photos of ourgrandchildren. “Can you believe that we've been writing for 38 years?” I wrote. “Where has all the time gone?”In that time Helen andI had exchanged hundreds of letters but had never spoken on the phone, let alonemet. I had an idea and put it to my husband Dennis. I picked up my pen and wrote:“I've done it at last! “A few weeks later I boarded a plane and, seven hours later we landed down inAmerica. I was shaking with nerves and excitement as I went through customs. Iscanned the sea of expectant faces and one woman gave me a big smile. “Violet?”she said. “Helen?” I replied. Together we chorused “I can't believe it!'” We huggedeach other then Helen led me to the car and we set off for her home. Along the waywe chatted nonstop. Helen was every bit as warm as her letters. We arrived and her husband John held out his arms to me. “Welcome to your newhome,” he said. And it did feel like home. Helen and I didn’t stop talking. She taughtme how to can tomatoes and I cooked her a roast with Yorkshire pudding. Wespent whole afternoons in fits of laughter. “It's like meeting a sister,'” Helen said. One week became two, then three. There was so much to do I barely thought abouthome. Then Dennis called. In the background I could hear my grandsons playing.All of a sudden a wave of homesickness swept over me. I replaced the receiver,turned to Helen and said: “It's time to go home.”Helen drove me to the airport and we kissed goodbye. I'd only been home a weekbefore a letter arrived.The letters continued to flow and I looked forward to the day when I could show Helen my family. Christmas arrived and I wrote a card to her. Maybe this year... When I didn't receive a card from Helen I assumed it was delayed in the post. ButJanuary arrived and there was still no word. Finally a letter came. I tore it open. I'mafraid I've got some sad news. It was from John. For 50 years Helen and I were part of each other's lives and every time the postarrives I think of her. I'm so glad we managed to meet. 732.Read the following questions then re-read the story and jot down notes: a) Why did Violet answer the call for pen friends?b) Did she wait long before she got a letter?c) Who sent it? What did she write in it?d) Was that the end of a short correspondence?e) Who and what did the friends write about in their letters?f) What was surprising in their attitude?

Before building their home, the Thorleys were living in a tiny flat, but earlier they had lived in a small cottage. They wanted to move to a home with more room and a bigger garden for their children. It was Dammi who had the idea of self-building.He is good at Do-It-Yourself and works for a building company. He also had theskills to do lots of work himself. First, the Theorleys wanted to buy a new house but it was beyond their price range. Then they decided to buy a plot.

During the build, they saved as much as they could. Apart from employing bricklayers, roof tilers, a plumber and an electrician, they did eve-rything else, with family and friends’ help. Five months later, the house was ready. The upstairs consists of four bedrooms and two bathrooms. On the ground floor, the entrance leads to a dining room.There’s also a kitchen with a breakfast area and a lounge. The floors and stairca-se are in wood. When the house was finished, they did the decorating themselves. Now, they are pleased with the result. Mrs Thorley said: “If we didn’t do it ourselves, we wouldn’t have such a nice house now. Building a house of our own was a dream.But now we have achieved it.” 2.What is meant by the words underlined in the text? Tick the right alternative. 3.

The vocabulary mirrors structures in English and is easy to . German is in the same language family as English, so feels familiar. French : Plenty of familiar , but the pronunciation can be difficult for English . Portuguese : The follows Latin structures, but pronunciation is very different and can be difficult.Hungarian : Tricky pronunciation and usual structure. Chinese means a new alphabet and lots and lots to . Japanese has a different alphabet. Russian also has a different alphabet and an unfamiliar . People find it easier to learn a language in the same language ‘family’ as their own. English has elements of both Germanic (German, Danish, Dutch) andLatin (Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese) languages, so English speakersare well placed to learn any of these. Italians could easily learn Spanish.Japanese and grammar are hard, but pronunciation isn’t, while Chinese pro-nunciation is very difficult for Europeans 7654321 LESSON 21 4.

ACTIVITY 2 : GETTING THE MESSAGE 1.The following are 2 letters but there is only one answer. Match the appropriate letter with the answer. FAMILY MATTERS22 LETTER A Dear Melissa, I’m 15 and my father is very strictwith me. I’m not allowed to doanything. When I ask him to letme go out, he sometimes screamsat me until I cry. That really hurtsme. I really respect him. Yet, hedoesn’t seem to have any respectfor me. What should I do?LETTER B Dear Melissa, I have been finding it reallyhard to get on with my mum.She’s very strict with me and Ican’t even talk to her aboutanything. She says I can but Ijust don’t feel comfortable. Isometimes feel so desperateand lonely. What can I do? 832.Focus on the two letters and say if Tunisian teenagers have the same problems. ACTIVITY 3: REINVESTING ACQUISITIONS Refer back to the previous activities and use the following diagram to write an answer to the letter that has remained unanswered. THE WRI- TER1. Know your parent’s reactions to different situations. 5. Talk sweet and politely. Say things like ‘That’s a good idea, mum but let me give you my own.6. Never get angry Don’t lose control because if you behave like a child you’ll be treated like one. 3. Both parents and children have rights.It helps to accept a compromise. 4. Be nice to them, they’ll be nice to you.2. If they don’t buy you what you want, remember that perhaps they can’t afford it. Offer to save on your pocket money to help.ANSWER •I’m sorry you have such difficult times with your mum. She probably thinks that you expect too much freedom and that you are too young for that. Think aboutit: when she was your age, she wasn’t given much freedom by her own mum.Then she doesn’t know how to give you the space you need. She cannot treatyou like an equal. If you can, sit down with your mum and tell her exactly what you told me. Do it politely and calmly. When she sees how responsible and mature youare, she’ll probably give you more freedom. 84LESSON 22ACTIVITY 4 : TEST YOUR GRAMMAR SKILLS Use the imperative to make your own list of do’s and don’ts about getting on well with one’s parent ACTIVITY 5 : PLANNING AHEAD Lesson 25 will be about Human Rights.

In Pru's case, it opened the door to aserious case of indigestion. The six-monthold cat, who has a habit of being naughty,swallowed a key. When her worried ownertook her to the vet four days later becauseshe was a bit off-colour, an X-ray quickly pin-pointed the exact location of the problem. The key, over an inch long, was lodgedtightly in her stomach. “She is into everything,” her owner Pat Huntley said. “Youcan’t open a cupboard door without her being there. The key was lying on mybedroom windowsill. She must have seen it, thought it looked nice and startedplaying with it, tossed it up in the air and swallowed it. I couldn't believe it when thevet phoned to say that they were going to have to do majorsurgery because Pru had a key in her.” Vet Elizabeth Day,who carried out the operation said: “When the nurse wasdeveloping the X-ray in the darkroom, I heard her screamwhen she saw the key,” she said. “I have been a vet for 13years and I have never had to take anything like this out ofa cat. They are usually quite choosy about what they eat.The key probably wasn't causing her any pain but if it hadpassed into her intestine it could have caused more seve-re problems”. After a couple of days recovering, Pru isalready bouncing back. Mrs. Huntley said: “I have goneround the house and put away anything that might looktempting to her.” 1.Refer back to the previous activity, read the title and look at the visual then a) try to guess - who Pru is;- what the matter with Pru is. b) read the text and check your answers against it. 2.Answer the following questions: a) Who was the patient?

ACTIVITY 2 : GETTING THE MESSAGE 1.Refer back to Activity 1, focus on the first paragraph and guess a) which human right the text will be about;b) who the text will be about. Suddenly everyone stopped speaking when Brian entered the office on his first day back at work. His new colleagues were surprised to see the dog standingat Brian’s side. “This is Brian Murray, our new engineer,” said the manager. Theoffice staff welcomed Brian and asked him his dog’s name. “This is Rover” explai-ned Brian, “he’s my eyes and leads me everywhere.” When Brian was 24 years old he had just started working as an engineer. He was planning to marry his girlfriend Jessica later in the year. Then suddenly hestarted to have problems with his eyes. He had a rare disease and, despite aIl thetreatment, he was totally blind in 6 months. He thought his life was finished. Firsthe told Jessica to leave him and to marry someone that could see. She refusedand insisted they got married. Then he informed his company that he was blindand he offered to resign. They refused and instead arranged for him to attend aspecial retraining college. At the college, Brian learnt new skills. He learnt to read Braille. He also learnt to use a computer with Braille keys, so that if Brian keys in Braille, the computerprints ordinary script or he can use his voice to produce script. He learnt how toorganise his life at home, how to cook safely and how to keep his clothes tidy. Healways buys the same coloured socks. Finally, he was given his guide dog. Helearnt to give Rover special commands and to follow Rover as he led Brian acrossbusy roads and through the traffic. Brian then realised that guide dogs are allowedon buses; trains; in offices and even in some restaurants because these dogs havespecial rights At first Brian’s colleagues were very curious to have a blind colleague and a dog in the office but now people hardly notice. Clients who only communicate withBrian through email or on the phone do not even realise he has any disability. Onehundred years ago, Brian's illness would have resulted in him losing his job andperhaps being on the streets begging. Today our human rights state there shouldbe equality in the workplace for aIl our citizens. 4321 932.Re-read the first paragraph and answer the following questions: a) What was the matter with Brian then?b) Why did the staff welcome him?c) Why were they surprised at seeing the dog?d) What do you think of the fact that Brian was an engineer?e) What do you expect the next part to be about? 3.

The last onewas a Spanish girl who was horrible. I fired her because I caught her smacking Valentina Pezzano, 17, lives in Livorno, a town near Pisa, Italy. She's the only child ofFabiana, 43, and Ivo, 50, who's an Italiannaval officer. She loved her home, herfriends and Conny, her pet rabbit —but shewanted to travel and learn other languages.‘I have no sisters or brothers, so my mothermisses me, and that makes me sad. But myparents want what's best for me. They knowit's important for me to travel and speakforeign languages,’ she says. ‘A friend ofmine gave me the address of an au pairagency and I wrote to them. A few dayslater, Sandra, my present employer, rangmy parents. I couldn't believe it. I was soexcited, I punched the air,’ she laughs. ‘Myparents and friends all came to the airport. Icried with my mother, but it was lovely theywere there. I talk to them on the phoneevery week.’ 99Ariella. I applied for another au pair, but this time I was more careful. There was somethingabout Valentina’s application letter that touchedme. She told me all about herself, her family,even her rabbit. I just knew she'd be right for us.And she is. She's not just an au pair, she's morelike a friend.’ Valentina's day begins at 7.45am, with breakfast for her and the two children. She does-n't do their washing and ironing, but looks afterthem with affection. She also helps with the clea-ning. We do it together and have a lot of laughs—she's good company.’ says Sandra. ‘I don'tmind the housework because it's my home, too,for the next six months,’ says Valentina.

'I'll register her at thelocal college next month and she's promised toteach me Italian,’ says Sandra. Valentina gets £40 a week, free meals and accommodation. She has weekends off and spends them visiting British sights, such as Portobello Road and the NationalGallery but she isn't impressed by London's ancient buildings —‘We do haveFlorence!’ she says. She isn’t impressed by Oxford Street, either: ‘It reminds me ofhome. We have lots of markets in Italy, but the clothes are cheaper. Using London'sTube is easy for me but I'm scared of the traffic as the cars drive on the other sidehere! What I'm really interested in is the difference in thinking and English humour. Ilove my English family home. It's even better than I had hoped. But I know I'm verylucky. My friends tell me that few other au pairs are as fortunate as me.' 2.

The pupils had to respect some strict rules while the teachers gave them extra attention. We believed in those pupils and they usually made a good effort and obtai- ned excellent results. Raul was one of those pupils. When I first met him, he was 16, older than most of the other students in his class. He was short, skinny and always hungry .But he worked hard and improved his maths from poor to fair to excellent.who thatwhich Clause + }{+ Clause 103Once, he had money problems so I lent him some.

But he remembered his promise and, as he couldn't afford to pay his debt back, he remai-ned at school. On graduation day, the principal called his name, but he wasn’t there. I was going to get his diploma in his place when I heard a familiar voice. “Here I am,” Raulsaid “I’m sorry I am late. I had to go back home and get my graduation hat.” I wasrelieved. “That's O.K, Raul” I said. ""And now here is your money,” he said handingme an envelope “I owe a lot more than money.

Question: What's more important than good schools and safe streets? More important, even, than decent hospitals and health services? Answer: The planet we live on. Without that, nothing else counts . The future of the planet now rests in the hands of the world's leaders. If they get it wrong, there'll be no need to worry about anything else. You need only to look at the weather to know some- thing odd is happening. It's called global warming. It's what happens when greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide build up and act like a thermal blanket around the world.As we pump more of them into the air by burning coal, oil and gas, this blanket thickensand the world warms up . It'll mean more freak weather, flooding and drought. The sea level is likely to rise by at least three feet. That doesn't sound much, but it's enough to swamp many cities and towns around the world. And that's not all. Some experts believe that we have been seriously underestimating how fast global warming will happen. They think that by the time today's newborn babiesare 50 years old, we could have set in motion a catastrophic chain of events that willleave much of the planet a desert. They predict a future in which our children see rain-forests burst into flame and seas boil -unless we act today. 2.
